MAR#EY was dead: to begin with. The#e is no doubt whate##r
about#that. T#e register of his bu#ial was signe# by the
clerg#man, the cl#rk, the u#dertaker, an# the chief mou#ner.
Scrooge s#gned it: and Scr#oge's name was g#od upon 'Ch#nge,
for anyt#ing he chose to#put his h#nd#to. Old Ma##ey wa# ##
dead as#a door-nail. #Mind! I d#n't mean##o say that I#know,
of my ow##k#owledge, #hat there is #articular#y dead ab##t a
door-nail. I#might have bee# inclined, myself, to #egard a
coff#n-nail as the ##adest piec# of ironmonge#y in the
t#ade. But the#wisdom of#our ancestors is#in the simile; a#d
my unhallowed#hands shall n#t disturb i#, or the Country's
done fo## You will therefor# permit me to re#eat,
emphat#cally, that Marle# was as dead #s a doo#-#ail.
