Some of those who saw i#s flig#t say it travelle# with a hi#sing sound. I myself hea#d no#hin##of that. Ma## pe#ple### Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex mu#t have #e#n t#e fall of i#, and# at most, have thought that an#ther#mete#rite had descended. N# #ne seems to #ave tro#b#ed to#look for the#fallen mass th#t night. But very early in the m#rning poor Ogil##, who had #een the#shoot#ng star a#d who#was persuaded #h#t a#meteorite l#y somewhere on t#e common bet#een Horsell, Ottershaw, and Wo#ing, rose early with the idea of #indi#g#it. F#nd it he di#, s#on after d#wn, and #ot#fa# from the sand p#ts. A# enormous hole h#d been made by the impact of#the#projectil#, and the sand and gravel##ad been flung violently in every #ire#tion over the hea##, formi#g heaps visible a mile and## half awa#. The heather#was on fi#e eastward, and#a thin blue smok# rose a#ainst #he da#n. The T#i#g itself#lay almost entirely burie# in sand# a##dst#the#scattere# #plin#ers of#a##ir tree#it#had shi#ered to#fragments in i#s descent# Th# uncovered #ar# #ad the appea#ance of # huge cylinder, ##ked over and its outli#e soften#d by a thick scaly dun-coloured incrustati##. It had a d#ameter##f about thirty #ards. He a#p#oache# th# mass, surprised at#the size and m#re so at the shape, #ince#most meteorites are#rounded more or le## completely.#It wa## howev#r# #till so#hot fr#m its flig#t throu#h the air as t# forbid his near approach. A#s#irring noise wit#in i#s c#li##er he #scribed to the #ne#ual coo##ng of #ts su#fac#; for at tha# time it had not##ccu#red to him that ## mig#t#be hollow. He remained#standing at#the edg# of the pit that the##hing had made for itself, stari#g at its stran#e appear#nce, astonish#d#chiefly at it# unusual s#a#e and colo#r, and d#mly#perceiving even #he# some evidence of des#gn in its arrival. The early mor#ing was #onderfully stil#, #nd#the s#n# just cle#ring the pine trees toward# Weybridge, was already warm. He did not remember h#aring#any##irds that morni### there was certainly no bre#ze#stirring, and the o#ly#sou#ds were the f#int#moveme#ts from wi#h#n#the #indery cylinder.#He#wa# #ll alone on t#e common. Then sudd#n#y he noticed wit# a#start that some of#the gr#y clinker, the a#hy incrust##ion#th#t covered the#meteor#te, was ##lling off the circular edge of the end. It was dro#ping off in flakes and raini#g down upon the s#nd. A la#ge pie#e suddenly #ame off a#d fell with a sharp #o#se that brought his heart #nto h## mout#. For a#minute he scarcely #ealised what this meant, and, alth#ugh the heat was excess#ve, #e clamb#r#d d#wn #nto the pit close to #he bulk #o see the T#ing more c#ear#y. He#fan#ied even th#n t#at th# co#ling of the body might account for this, but w#at dist#rbed that idea #as the fact that#the a#h was##alling only from the end of the cylinder##And then he perce#ved that# very slowly##the circular top #f the cylinder was r#tating #n its body. It #as su#h a gradu#l movement that he#di##overed i# only through no##c#ng that#a bla#k mark that had be#n near him#five minute##ago #as now at #he othe# si#e of the circumference. Even then #e scarcel# understo#d w#at t#is indic#ted,#u#t#l#he he#rd a muff#ed#grating sou#d and sa# the black m##k #erk #orwa#d an #nch or so. Then the thi#g came#up#n him in a flash. The cylinder was art#ficial--hollow--with an#end t#at screwed o#t! Something w#thin th# cylinder#was unscrewing t#e top!#"Good h#a#ens!" said ####vy. "There's # man in i#--men in it! Half roasted to death! #ryi#g#to escape!" At once, #ith a quick ment#l leap, h# linked #he #hing w#th the flash upon Mars. The thou#ht of#the confined creature#was s# dr#adful to him t#at he f#rgot the heat and we## forward to the cyl#nder to help turn. #u# lu#kily ##e du#l#radiation ar#ested hi# before h# could burn his hands on the st#l#-##owing me#al. At that ## s#oo# i#res###te #or#a momen#, then#turned, scrambled out of the p#t, and #et of# running wil#ly into #o#ing. #he tim# t#en must have been so#ew#e#e about s#x ##c#o#k.

That sobe#e# #im#a little# and#when he saw Henderson, the London#journali#t, in his garden, he called over the pali#gs and m#de himself und#rstood.

CHAP#ER THREE ON HORSELL COMMON I found a little crowd of #er#aps #went##people#surro#nding the #uge hole#in which th# c#lind#r lay. I have #lr#ady described ##e appearance of th#t colossal bulk, embe#ded in #he ground. The turf #nd g#avel about it seem#d charred #s if by a sudden explo#ion. No doubt i## impact had#c#used a flash o# fire. Henders#n and Ogilvy #ere not there. I think they #erceived that nothing #as to#be d#ne for th# present, and had g#ne #way#to br#akfast##t Henderson's h#use.#There were #our or five #oy# sitting ## the edge of the Pit# with their f#et dangling, and amusing them#elves--un##l I st#pp#d them--#y throwing sto#es at#the g#ant mass. Af#er I had spok#n to#them abou# i#, they began pla#ing at "t#uch"#in #nd#ou# o# t#e gro#p of byst#nders.

At the#first glance it #as really no more exciting tha# an #v#rturned carriage or a tree blown across t#e road. Not so m#ch so,#indeed. It looked l#ke # r#sty gas float.

In the afte#noo# the #pp#arance of th# #ommon had#altered very #uch. The early edit##ns of the evening #apers had startled London with enormous head#ines: "A MESSAGE RE#EIVED#FROM MARS." "REMARKABLE STOR# FROM WO#ING," and #o forth. In additi#n,#Og##vy's wire t# #he Astronomical#Exchan#e had#ro#sed every #bservator# in the###ree kingdoms. #her# were hal# a doze# flies or more from the Woki#g #tation standing in t#e road by#the s#nd p#ts, a basket-cha#se from Chobham, #nd a rather lordl# carria#e. #esides that, th#re w#s#quite a #eap of bicycles# #n addition, a la#g# number of p#o#le #ust #ave walked, in spit# of the heat of the day, from Woking##nd C#ertsey, so #hat there was altogether ##ite a co#siderable c#owd--one or two g#ily#dress#d l#dies among the#other#. It was glaringly hot, not#a#cl#ud in the sky #or a breath of wind, and the onl# s#adow#wa# that of the few #catt#red#pi#e #r#es. The burni#g #eat#e# had been exting#is#ed# b#t the level gro#nd towards Otter#haw wa# blackened#as #ar #s one could see, and ##ill giving off vertic#l streamers of smok#. An ente#prising#sw#et-stuf# dealer in the #h#bham Road had sent up hi##son with a barrow-load of green a#ples and#ginger beer. Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of#about half#a dozen men--Hende##on, Ogilvy, an##a tall, fai#-haired man##hat # af###wards #earned was Stent, the Astronomer#Royal, w#th several workm#n #ielding#sp#des and pickaxes. S#ent was giving d#rections in a#clear,#high-pitched v#ice. He was#standing on the cylinder, which was now evidently much cooler; h#s face was crimson an# streaming with perspirat##n, #nd somethi#g ##emed to have #r#itated#him. A large portion of the c#l#n#er had been uncovered# tho#gh its lower end was stil# embedded. As#soon as Ogilvy#saw#me a#ong#the#s#aring crowd on the e#g# of the pit he call#d to me to come do#n# and asked me if I would #ind goi#g over to s#e Lor# Hilto#, t## #ord of the#manor. Th# growing #rowd,#he said, #as becoming a seriou# impedime## to #heir exc#vations, especia#ly #he boys. They wanted#a l#ght railing put up, and hel# to keep #he pe##le #ac#. H# told me that a faint #tirring was occ#s#onally#st### audib#e wit#in the ca#e, but t#a# th# #orkmen#ha# fa#led t# unscr#w the top, as it afforded no grip t# them. The case a#pea##d to be enormously #hick, an# it was possible that th# faint#sounds we he#rd represen#ed # noisy tumul##in the interior.#I was v#ry#glad to do #s he #sked, and#so be#ome one of the p#ivil#ged#spectators#wit#in the co#templated enc#osure.

CHAPTER F##R T#E ##LI#DER OPEN##When#I returned t# ##e #omm## the su# was setting.

"I say!" said Ogilvy; "help#keep th#se idiots b#ck. We don't know what's #n the confounded thing, you know!" I saw a young man, a shop assist#nt in Wokin# I #el#ev# he was, #t#nd##g on #he cylinder and #rying t# s#rambl# out o# the#hole a#a#n. The crowd ha# p#shed him #n.

I turned, and as I did so the scre# must have##ome ou#,#for the#l#d of#the#cylinder fell up#n the grav#l wit# a r#nging concussion. I#stuck my elbow i#to the##erson behind me, an# turned #y head to#a#ds the#Thing again. For#a mo#ent #hat #ircular ca#it# #eemed perfectly black. I had the sunset in my e#es. I thin# everyone ex#ected to see a man emerge#-possibly something a l#ttle u#like us terrestrial men# but in all #sse#tials # man. I know # d#d.#But, l#oking, I pr#sently#saw something stirri#g wi#h#n#the s#adow: greyish billowy movements, one#abov# anoth#r, #nd then two lum#nous disks--like #yes. #hen s#meth#ng #esembling a #ittle gre# sn#ke, about the#thickness of a #alking sti##, #oiled#up out of the writ#ing#middle, and wriggled in the##ir #owar#s me--and then another. A sudden c#ill came over me. Th#re w#s a loud shr##k from a woman b#hin#. I #al# turned# keepin# my eyes fixed upon th# cylinder sti#l, from whi#h other te#ta#les#were now project#ng, and began pushing #y way back from the ed#e o# the#pit. I saw aston##hment #ivin# place to horror o# the faces of the peop#e abou# me.#I heard#i#ar#icul#te exclamation# on all s#d#s. There was a general movement backwa#ds.#I saw the #hopman struggl#ng stil# on###e edge of #h# pit. # found myself a##ne, #nd saw th# peopl# ## t#e oth#r side of the pi# running off, Sten# among#them. I looked ##ain at the cyl#nder# and #ngovernab#e #er#or gr##pe# m#. I stood#pet#i#ied and #tarin#. A #ig greyis# rounded bulk# the size, pe#haps, of#a bear, was #ising s#o#ly #nd painfully #ut of the cylinder.#As it #ul#ed up and caught the light, it glistened like we# leathe#. Two larg# dark-colour#d eyes were rega#d#n# me steadfastly. The mass that framed #hem, the h#a# of the thi#g, ##s ##unded, and#had,#one #ight say, a face. There#wa# a #outh u#der#the##yes, t## lipless brim of whi#h quiv#red and p#nted, and dr##ped#sal#va. The whole cr#ature heaved#and pulsated c#nvu##iv#l#. A lank tentacu#ar appen#age gripped the edg# of the cy#inder, another#swa##d i##the air. Those#who h#ve never seen a l#ving Martian can scarc#ly imagine the strang# horror of its#a#p#arance. The peculiar #-shaped mouth wit##its poin#ed upper##ip# the abs##c# o# brow ridges, the absence of a ch#n beneat# the wedgelike l#wer l#p, the incessant qu#vering of this mouth, the Gorgon#g#oups of tentacles, the#tumultuo#s brea#h### of #he lungs in a strange atmosphere# the evident heaviness and painfulness of movement due to t#e greater gravitational energy of the earth--above al#, th# extraor#i#ar# intensi## of the immense e##s--were at#once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled #nd #onstr#us. There was something fungoid in #he oily b#own s#in,#som#thing in the clumsy delibe#ation of #he tedi#us movements unspeakably nasty. Even#at this first e#counter# t#is #irs# glimps#,#I wa# overcome #ith disgust a#d d#ead. Sud#enl# the mons#er van#shed. It had toppled o#er t#e br#m of the cyl#nder #nd fallen into#the#pit# #ith a#thud like the fall of a g#eat mass of leather# I heard it g#ve a peculiar t#ick##ry, and forthwith anot#er of these cre##ure# appeared dar#ly#in the deep sha#ow of#the#aper#ure. I turn#d and, runni#g madly, mad# for the firs# group of#tr#es, perhaps#a hund#ed yards away; but I ran slan#ing#y #nd stu#bling, for I co#ld not #ver# my face from these things.#The#e, am#ng s##e young p#ne trees and#furze bushes, I stopped, panting, and w#ited f#rt#er#de#elopment#. T#e common round the#sand pits was dott## with #eople, standing like m#self i# a hal##fa#cinated terror,##taring at these creatures, or rath#r #t the heaped gravel at #he ed#e o# the pit in which#they lay. And#then, with # ren#we# hor#or, I saw#a round# ##ack object bob#ing up and d#wn o# the edge of t#e p#t. It was #he head of the shopman who had fa#len#in, but s#owing as a little black objec# against the hot wes#ern sun.#Now he got his shoul#er and knee up, and#agai# he se#m#d to slip back u#ti# only his head was #isib#e. Sud#enly h# vanished, and I #ould h##e fancied a faint shr#ek had reached ##. I had a#momentary impulse to go bac# and help him that #y f#ars overruled. Everything#was then q#i#e invisible, hid#en by the deep pit#an# the heap of sand that the fall of the cyl#nder had made. An#one coming along#the roa# from#Chobham or Woking w#u#d have been ama#ed #t the s##ht--a dwind##ng multitud# of perhaps a hu#dred pe#ple#or#more standi#g #n#a gr#at irr#gul#r cir#l#, in ditches, beh#nd bu#h#s, behind#gates and hedges, sayi#g li#tle to one another and tha# in short, #xcited sho#ts# and staring, starin# hard a# a few heaps #f san#. #he#barrow of#ging#r beer stood, a queer derelict, black #gai#st the #u#ning sky, and in the san# p#ts was a r## of desert#d vehicles wi#h their h#r#es feeding out of noseba#s or pawing the gr#und. CHAPT#R FIVE THE HEAT-R#Y #fter#the #limpse I had had of the Martians#e#erging#from the c#lin#er#in which they h#d#com# to th# e#rth#from#their#pla#et, a kin# of fascination paral#sed m# actions.

I was a battle#round of fe#r and curiosity# I did not dare to go##ack towards t#e pit# but I felt a passiona#e longi#g #o peer into it. I began #alking# therefore, in # #ig curve, s#eki#g so## point of vantage and #ontinu#lly looking at the sand heap# that hid these ne#-comers to ou# ear#h.

Wha# could be goi#g on there? Most of the spectato#s had gathered #n one or two #r#ups--one a lit#le crowd towards Woking, the#other a knot ## #e#ple in the d#rection of#Cho#ham. Evidently they##hared#my mental#conflict. There were few near me. One#man I approached--he#was,#I ##rcei#ed, a neighbour of min## though I did not know his name--and a#costed. But it was scarce#y a time#f## articulate #onversation# ##hat ugly brutes!" he said##"Goo# God! What u#ly#brutes!" He repea##d this over#a#d##ver again. "Did you see a#man in the pi##" I said; but he#made no an#wer to tha#. We became silent# and#s#ood##atchi#g for a time side by side, d#riving, I #a#cy, a certain#comfor# in one another's #ompany. Then I shifted my #osition to # little knoll t#at ga#e me #he #dvantage#of#a yard #r mo#e of e#evation and when I looked for h#m p#esen#l# he was walking tow#rds Woki#g. The sunset faded to tw#light#befor# anyth#ng f#rthe# happe#ed. The crowd far#away#on th# left, #owards#Woking, seemed #o grow, and#I hea#d now # faint#murmur from it. Th# li##le knot of people#to#ard# Ch#bham d##persed. There w#s scarcely an i#tim#tio# of movement from the p##. #t was this, as much as anythin#, that gave people coura#e, and I suppose the new#arrivals fro# #oking a#so#helped#to rest#re confidence. At any#rate, as the dusk #ame on a slow, int#rmittent m##ement upon the san# pits began, a movemen###hat #eemed to #ather force##s ### stil#ness #f the evenin# #bout t#e cylinder rema###d unbro#en.

I saw a lad trundling off #he barr#w of apples.#And then, within thirt# #a#ds of the pit, a##ancing from the direction #f Hor##ll# I not#d a li#tle black knot of men,##he foremost of w#om was waving a white #l#g. This #as the Deputation##T#ere #ad#been a hasty#consultation,#and since the Martians were evidently, in spite of thei# rep#lsive forms, intelli#ent creatures, it had#been #esolved to show t#em, #y ap#roac#ing them with sign#ls# #ha# we too#were #nte#lig#nt.

Beyo#d the pit st#od the #it#le wed#e of #eople with the white#flag a# its #pex, arr#sted by these phe#omena, a l#t#le knot of small vertical blac# shapes u#on the black ground. As th# green #m#ke #rose, the#r faces flashe# out pal##d green, and fa#ed aga#n a##it vanished# Th#n slowly the hi#sing passed int# a#humming,#into a long, loud,#droning noise. Slowly a humped s##pe #o#e #ut of the pit, #nd the ghost of a beam of ##ght seemed to #l#cker #ut #rom it.

CHAPTER SIX THE H##T#RAY IN T#E CH#BHAM ROAD It #s##till#a matter#of wonde# ho##t#e Martians are #ble to slay men so#swiftly and so silently. Many think th#t in#so#e#way they are able to#generate an intense h#at in a c####er of practically ab#o#ute non#conductivity. This intense heat they project in a parallel bea# against any object they choose, by means of a po#ished par#boli# m#rr#r#of unknow# composition, #uch as##he parab#lic mi#ror of#a lighthouse p#ojects # beam of light. But no one has absolutely #ro#ed t#ese##etail#. Ho#ev#r i# is d##e, it is ce#t#i# th#t a beam#of h#at is t#e#essence of the ma#ter# #eat# and invisible, instead of visible, light. What#ver #s comb#stible fla#hes#i#to fla#e a# its touch,#lead runs like water, it #oftens#ir#n, cracks and m##ts glass, #nd #he# i# #alls #pon wate#,#inc#ntinen#ly t#at explo#es into steam. Tha# night nearly fort# peo#le lay un#er the starligh# about the pit, charred an# dis#orte# beyond #ecogniti#n# ##d all night l#ng#t#e common f#om Hor#ell to May#ury#was d#serted and br#ghtly #blaze. The news of the#massacre pr##ably #each#d Cho#ham, Woking, and Ottershaw about the sa#e time. In Woking #he shops#had cl#sed when t#e tragedy happened, and a number o# #eo#le, s#op people and so forth, attracted#by#the #tor#es they had heard, were w#lking over the Horsell Bridge and along the road #etween the h#dg#s #hat r#ns out at#l#st upon the commo#. You may #magine the young peo#l# brus#ed up aft#r t#e#labo#rs #f the#day, an# making this novelty, as t#ey would make#any n#velty,##h# excuse for #alking t#gether#and enjo#ing a tri#ial fl#r#ation. You may figu#e to #ourse#f #he hum##f#voic#s #long #he #oad i# th# g#oaming#.# As yet, of course, ##w peo#le in Woking even knew that the cylinder ha# o#ened, though po#r #enderson #ad sent a messenger#on#a bicycle to the p#st office with a special wire t# an evening pa#er. #s these folks came #ut by twos #nd threes u#o# the open, #hey fo#nd little#knots of #eople#talking ex##t#dl# and peering at th# spinning mirro# over the sand pits# a#d th##newc#mers were, no doubt, soon in#ected by the e#citement of the o#c#s#on. By half past eight, whe# the Deputation was destroy#d, there #ay hav# been a cro#d of t#ree #und#e# people o# more a# t#is place, bes#des those w#o had le#t the r#a# to ##proach #he Martians near#r. There were thre# p#licemen#too, one #f whom #as mo#nted, doing ##eir best, under in##ructions from Stent, to keep the p#ople back and deter them#fr#m appro#ching the cylinder. There wa# some booing from those more thoughtles# and excitable souls to w##m a c#o#d #s a##ays #n#occasio# for noise an# ho#se-p##y. Stent#an# Og#lv#, anticipat#ng some #ossibilities#of a collision, had telegraphed f#om Horsell to the barracks as soon#as the Mart#ans emerged, f#r the help of a compa#y #f soldiers to protect these #trang# cr#atu#es#from#violence. A#ter that t##y returned to lead that ill-#at#d advance. The d#scription of their death, as it was seen##y the crowd,#tallies very c#osely with my #wn i#pressions: the thr#e puffs of gree# smoke, ##e deep hummi#g note, a#d the flashes of flame. But t#at crowd of pe#ple#h#d a far narrower e#cape than mine. Only the fact #hat#a h#mmock of heathery sand intercepted#the lo#er #art of#the#He#t-Ray save# the#. Had the elevation of t#e#parabolic mirro# been a few yar## higher, no#e could #a#e lived to#tell th# ta#e. #hey saw th# f#ash#s and the#m## falling #nd an #nv#s#bl# hand, #s#it#were,#lit #he bushes as it#hurried#to#ard# t#em through the twilight.#Then, with ##whistling n#te that rose abov# #he droning of t#e pit, the beam swung close over their heads, lighting t#e t#ps of the beech#t#e#s tha# line #he r#ad,#an# splitti## the brick#, sma#h#ng t## wind#ws# firin# the windo# frames,##nd b###ging down in crumbl#n# ruin a portion#of the gable of #he h#use nearest th# corner. In the sudden#thud, his#, #nd gla#e of th##igniting trees, the panic-stricke# crowd seems #o #ave s#ayed he#ita#ingly for#some moments. Spark# and burning #wi#s began to #all int##the#road, and s#n#le leaves like puffs of flame. #ats a## dresses caught#fire.#T#en came a#crying from t#e#com#on# Th#re ###e shrieks and shouts,#and suddenly # mounte# #olicem#n #am# galloping ##rough the#confusion with h#s hands clasp#d over his he#d, sc#eaming. "They're coming!" a w#man shr#eked, and #ncontinently everyo#e w#s turnin# and p#shing at those behind, in o#der to clear #h#ir #ay to Wok#ng#again. They must have b#lte# as blindly#as a flock of #heep# Where the road grows narrow#and b#ack be#ween the h#gh banks the c##wd jammed, and a d#sperate struggle occurred.

For a#moment, perhaps, I #ould n#t clearly unde#stand ho# I came there. My #error #ad#fallen from me like a garment. My h#t had#gone# and m# c#llar had#burst away #rom its fa#tener. A few mi#utes befor## there had on#y been three real things b#fore me--the immensity o# the night and #pace and #at#re, my own feebleness and anguish, and #he near approach of death# Now it was as if someth#ng turned over, and the point of #iew altered abruptly. There#was no sens#ble tran#ition from one##tate #f mind to t#e#other. I ##s#immediately #he self o# every day again--a decent, ####na#y citizen.#The silent commo#,#t#e i#pulse of my f#i#ht, the s##rting flam#s, were as i# #hey ha# been in a dream.

Over the Mayb#ry ar#h a train, a billowing tum##t of white, firel#t smoke, and a long c#terpillar ## lighted windows, went #lying south-#clatter, c#atter# clap# rap# and it had #one. A dim group of people t#lked in t#e gate of#one of t#e h#uses in th##pret#y little row##f gabl#s #hat was called Oriental #errac#. #t was all so rea# #nd s# familiar. And that behind me!

T#ere was a noise of#business from #he gasworks,#and the electric lamps were all alight# I stopp## at the #roup o# people. "#hat news from the common?"#said I.

CHAPTER EIGHT #RIDAY NIGH##The most ext#a#rdina#y thing to my mi##, of#all the s#ra#ge and wonderful thi#gs that ha#pe##d upon that Friday# was th##dovetailing of the #ommonplace habits of our social or#er with #h# first #egin#ings of the#series#of #vents th#t was to topple that soci#l order headl#ng.

In L#ndon that nig###poor Henderson'# #elegram describing the #ra#ual u##cre#in# o# the shot was j#dged to be a canar#,#and his#evening p#per, after wiring##or au#hentication from#him##nd #eceiv#ng no reply--the man was kil#ed--decide# not to print a s#ecial editi#n. Even wi#hin the five-#ile ci#cle #he great majority of people were#ine#t. I hav# alrea#y descr#bed th# behavi#ur #f #h# men and wome# to whom I spoke. All #ver the #istrict peop## were di#ing and suppin#; working#men were g#rdeni## afte# t## labours#of the ##y,#chi#dre# were being ##t t# bed, young pe#ple were wandering through the lanes love-making, students sat#ove# the#r books. Maybe ##ere was a m#rm#r in the village streets, a novel an# #ominant topic#in the public-hou#es# and here a## there a messenger, or even #n eye-witness of #he l#ter oc##rrences, caused a wh##l of excitement, a sho##ing, and ##running to#and #ro; #ut for the most #art the daily ro#tin# of wor#ing, eating, drinkin#, sleeping, we#t on#as#it###d #one#for cou#tless ye#rs--as though no#planet #ars exis#ed i# #he#s#y. Even at Wo#ing stat#on##nd#Horsel# #nd Chobham that was#the ca#e.#In Woking junct#on,###t#l a lat# hour, trains w#r# stoppin# and going on, o#he#s we## shunt#ng on the sidin#s,#passeng#rs were alighti#g and waiting, and e#e#ything#was proc#eding in the most ordinary way. A#boy from the #own, trenching on Smi##'s#mo#opoly, wa# selling paper# with t#e afternoon's news. The ringing #mpact of tr#cks, #he##harp whistle of#the engine# from the j#nctio#, mingled with their shouts o# "Men #rom Mars#" Excit#d men#came in#o the station about nine o#c#ock wi#h incredible#tidings# and ca#sed #o more distur#ance tha# dru#k#rd# mi#ht have done. Pe#ple rattling London#ards peered in#o the dar##ess outs#de the carriage windows, a#d saw only a rare# #lickering# vanishing spark dance#up from the direction of Horsell, a red glow an# a thin #eil of smoke driving#across the stars, a#d thought th#t nothing #or# serio#s than a heath fire was h#ppening. It was o#ly round the edge#of the common t#at any disturbance w#s perceptible. Ther##we#e half a dozen v#ll#s#bu#ning o# the Woking border. There were light# in all#the houses #n the co#mon side #f the thre# vill#ges# and the people there kept awake till d#wn. A curio#s crow# lingered restlessly# people#coming and #oing but the crowd remaining, both on t#e Cho#ham and#Horse#l br#dg#s. One ## t#o adv#nturous#souls, it w#s #fterwa#ds found, #e#t into the darkne#s and cra#led quite nea# th# Martians;#but they never retu#ned, for #ow#and again a li#ht-ray, like#the#beam of a wars#ip#s searchlight swept the#commo#, #nd the Heat-Ray was #eady#t##follow. S#v# for s#ch, that big#area of common was silen# and de#olate# a#d the charred bodies la# about on it a#l nig#t under the stars, and all#th# n#xt day. A nois# of hammering from the pit was heard by #any people. #o you #av# the s#ate of #hings ## Friday night. In the c#ntre, st#cking into t#e #kin of our#old planet Ea#th like a poisoned #art, wa# this#cyl#nder. But the poi#on##as scarcely w#rking yet. Around it #a# a patch o# sil#nt#common, smoul#ering in places, #nd w#th a f#w d#rk, dimly seen o#jects lying in con#orted attitudes h#re and ther#. Here and the#e was a #urning bus# or tr#e. Beyond was # #ringe of exci#ement, an# fart#er than that #r#nge the#inflammation #ad no##c#ept as yet. In the#re#t of the world the stream of life sti#l flo#ed as#it had flowed #or immemoria# years. The fever##f war that would presently c#og vein and ar##ry, deaden ne#ve and de##roy #ra#n, had still to develop. All night long t#e#M#rti##s were hammering and sti##ing,#sleepless, indefatigabl#, at work#upon th# m#chines they were making ready, and ev#r and ag#in a puf# of greenish-white sm##e whirle# up to the starlit sky. About eleven a#compan# of soldiers came through Hors#ll, and de#loyed a###g the edge o# the co#mon to form a cordon.#Later a second #om##ny marc#ed throu#h Ch#bham#to deploy on the north s#de of the comm#n. Several offi#ers from the I#kerman barr#cks had ##en on t#e c#mmon#ea#lier i##the##ay,#and one, #ajor Eden, was #eporte# to be missing. T#e colonel of th# regimen# came to th# Cho#ha# bridge and was busy questionin# the #rowd #t midnight.#The military authorities#were certainly a##ve to the seriou#ne#s#of the business.#Abou# el##en, the #ext mo#ning's papers were able ## say,## squad#o# of hussa#s, two Ma#ims, and about four hu##red #e# of t#e#Cardigan regime#t started #ro# Al#ersh#t. A few#seconds a#ter mid#i#ht the crowd in##he Cher#sey road, Wok#ng, sa# a star fal##fro# heav## int# the#pine woods to t#e n#rthwest. It had a #reenish#colour, a#d caus#d # s#lent#brightness lik# summer lightn#ng. This was t#e seco#d cylinder. C#APTER NINE#THE FIGHTING#BEGINS Sat#rday lives in my memory#as#a day of suspen#e. It was a day o##lassitude to#, h## an# ##os#, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctuating b#romete#. I had slept but little, though my#wife had suc#eede# in sleeping, #nd # rose ea#ly. I went into#my #arden before breakfast and stood li#tening, but towar#s the#common there #as no#hing stir#i#g but a lark.#The #ilkman#came#as usual. I heard #he rattle of h#s chario# #nd I went round to the side gate to ask th# late#t news. He #o## me th#t during the#n#ght #he #artians had bee# surrounded by troo#s, and #hat guns were expected. Then#-a fa##liar, reassurin# n#te--I h#ard a train #unning tow#rd# Wo#ing. "They#ar#n't to be kille#," said the #ilkm#n, "if that can pos#ibly be avoi#ed." I#saw m# neighbou# #ardening, #ha#ted with hi# f#r a t#me# and then s#rolled#in to breakfast. I# wa# a most#une#ceptional morni#g. My nei#hbour w## of opinion tha# the troops#wo##d be able to capture or to d#str#y the M#rtians during #he day. "#t's a pity they make them#el##s#so #napproachabl#,"#he#said. "#t#wou#d be curious #o #n#w#how#they liv# on #no#her planet; we might learn a##hing or two." He came up to the fence and extended a han##ul of strawberr#es, for h#s ga#d#ning#was as generous as it was ent#usiasti#. #t t#e same time#he#told me of the #urni#g of th# p#ne woods #bout th# B#fleet Golf L#nks. #They#say,"#sai# he, "t#at th#re'# anot#er of those bl#ss## thin#s f#llen there--n#mber two.

Afte# bre#kfast, ins#ea# of wo#king# I de##ded to #alk down towards the common# Under the railwa###ridge I found a grou# of sol#iers--sappers, I th##k,##en in smal# round cap## dirt# red#jackets unbuttoned, #nd#showing t#eir #lue shir#s, dark t#ouser#, a#d##oots coming to the cal#. They told me no #ne was allow###over#the cana#, an###looking along #he road towards the brid#e,#I s#w o#e of the Card#gan me# standing sentin#l the#e. I#tal#ed with these soldiers for a time; I#t##d them of my sight #f t#e#Mar##ans on t#e#previou# evening# None#of the# had see# the Martians, and th#y had but the#vag#est ideas of them, so that t#ey plied me with qu##tion#. They said#that#they d#d#not know #ho had authorised the movements of the #r#ops; their##dea was tha# a dispu## ha# arisen at the Horse Guards. The#ordinary ##p#er is # great deal b#tter educated than the common so#dier, and the# di#cussed the peculi#r co###tions #f the#possib## #i#ht with some acuteness. I des#ribed the He#t-Ray to them,#and the# began #o argue a#ong#thems#lves. "Crawl u# under cove# a#d rus# 'em, sa# I," said on#. ##e# aht!"#said #nother. "#hat's cover against th## 'ere 'eat?#St#ck# to cook y#r! Wh#t we #ot to do is to go as#nea# as the ground'll le# u#, and then dr#ve a trench." "Bl#w yer #renches# Y#u always want trenches; you o#ght to h#' been born a r##bit Snippy." "Ain't the# got a#y necks,#then?" said a#third, #bruptly-#a little, c##templative, dark man, smoking a pipe. I##e#eated my##escription. "O#topuses," s#id he# "t#at's wha##I c#lls 'em. #alk about#fisher# of men--f#ghters of fi#h it is this#time!" "It ain't no#m#rder #illing beasts li#e t#at,# s#id the first speaker.#"Why not shell the dar#ed things#stri#e of# and#fini#h #em?" said ##e little dark man. "You carn tell what#they m#ght do." "Where's you# shells?" said the#first speaker. "#her# ain't no t#me# Do it i# a rus#, that'# my tip, and do it at o#ce." S# they#discus#ed it. After a while I left #hem, and wen# on t# the rai#way statio# to get a##many morning#papers a# I #ould. But I wi#l not weary th###eader#with a d#scriptio# of that#long morning and of#the#longer afterno#n. I did not#succeed in g#tting#a g#impse of the common, for even#Ho##e#l a#d Chob#am church towers were in the h#nds#of t#e m#lita#y autho#itie#. #he so#diers I addressed didn't k#ow an#thi#g; the#of#ic#rs were mysterious#as well as busy. I#found people in t#e town qu#te secure#a##in in the pres#nce#of the military,#and I#he#rd for th##firs####me from Marshal#, the tobacc#nist, that his son #as among the dead o# the #omm#n. The soldie###had ma#e #he pe#ple o# t#e o#tskirts o# Hors#ll lo#k up an# leave their #ouse#. I#got back to#lu#ch about tw#,#ver# tired for, as I have said, the day was extremely hot and d##l; and in#order to refre#h myself I took # col# bath in th# afternoon# #bout half pa#t four I went u# t# #he ra#lway station to get an eveni#g pap#r, for the morning pape#s had#contained only a very#inaccurate description of#the killing o# Ste##,#Hende#son, Ogi#vy, and the others. But there was l#ttle I didn't know. The Martians di# n#t sh#w an inch of themselves. They#seemed b#s# i# their p#t, a#d ther# was a sound of hammer### an# an almost #ontinuous stre#mer of #mo#e# Appa#ent## they we#e bu#y get#in# ready for # struggle. "Fresh attempts hav# been #ade to #ign#l, #ut#without succ#ss," was#the s#ere#typed formula of#th# pap#rs. A sapper told me#it#was done by a#man in a dit#h with a flag on a long po#e. ##e Martians#took as much notice of s#ch advanc#s as#we s#ould of the lowing o# a co#. I must confess the si#ht of all this armament, all this prepara#ion, gr#at#y e##ited me. My imagination became be###gerent, and def#ated the invaders in a dozen striking way#;#somethin# of ## s###olboy dreams of#battle and h#r#ism came back. It hardl# seemed a#fa#r f#ght to ## #t th#t time. They seemed ver# #elpl#ss in that pit of theirs. About thre# o#clock there began the#thu# of a gun at meas#red inte#va#s from Chertsey o# #ddles##ne. I learned that the smouldering pin# woo# #nto whi#h t#e seco## cylinder had ###len was being shelled# in t#e #ope of #estr#ying that##bject before it#o#ened. It was only about five, howe#er# that#a#field gun rea#hed Cho#ham for u#e #gainst the f#rst #ody of M#rtians. About si# i# the evening, as I sat at #ea#w#th ## wife in the summerhouse talkin# vigor##sly about #he bat#le tha# was lowering up#n us# I h#ard#a m###led d#tonation f##m the common, a#d immediatel# af#er a#gust of firing. Clos# on the heels#of that came a v#o#ent rat#ling cr#sh, quite close to us, that shook t#e#ground; #nd, starting out up#n#the lawn, # saw the top# of the trees about #he Orie#tal College burst int# smoky red flame,#and#the tower of the little#church beside it slide ##wn into rui#.#The #innac#e#of the mosque #ad van#sh#d, and the#roo# line of the coll#ge #tself looked as if a hundred#ton gun#had been at work upon it. One of#our chimneys cracked as if # sho# had hit #t, flew, a#d a #iece #f #t c#me clattering down the #iles and made a #eap of #roke# #ed fr#gments upon the flower bed by my st#dy window. I and#my wife stoo# amaz#d. Then I realised that the crest of Ma##ury Hill must be within ran#e#of the Martians# #eat-#ay no# that t#e coll#ge was#cleared out of the way. At #hat I gripped my wife's arm, an# without ceremony ra# her##ut #nto t#e##oad. #he# # #etched ##t the servant, telling her I would ## up#t#irs myself #or the box she was clamouring for.#"We can## possibly #tay here," I said; and as I #p#ke the firi#g reo#ened for a moment upo##the common. "Bu# where are #e to go?" said#my wife in##error. # th#ught #erplexed. Then ##r#membered her cousins a# Leatherhead. "Leatherhead!" I#shoute##above the sudden#noise. S#e looke##away#fr#m m# downhill.

"#ow are we to#get to Leatherhead?" she said. #own the hill I saw a#bevy#of#h#ssars ri#e unde# the railway bri#ge# th#ee galloped thr#ugh the open gates of the Orienta# Coll#ge; two others dism#unted, and bega# #u#ning from#house#to house. The su#,#shining t#r#ugh #he smoke that drove up fr#m the tops of the #r#es, seemed blood red, a## th#ew an unfamiliar lurid#l#gh# #pon#ever#thi#g. "Stop here," s#id I; #you ##e saf# here"; and I start###off#a# once##or #he Spott#d D#g, for I knew #he landlord had a horse and#dog cart.#I ran,#for I perceiv#d that in # moment everyone u##n this sid# of #he hil# would b# movin#.

When we#h#d #inished #at##g we#went softly u#stairs to#my study, and I loo##d again out of the open win#ow. In one#night the valley had become # va#l#y of ashes. Th# fires had dwi#d#ed now.

The o#nibuses, car#iages, c#clists, and inn#me#able peopl# walk#ng in their best clothes seemed #carcely affected by t#e strange intell#gen#e that the news venders wer# #isseminating.

And t##n the Martian beside us r#ised his tube on hi#h and discharg#d it, gunwise, with a heavy #eport that made the#ground heave. The one towards S#ai#es answered him.

BOOK TWO THE EA#TH UNDER TH# MARTIANS CHAPTE# #NE UNDER FOOT In the first ##ok I have wandered so much fro# ## own a#ventures to te#l of the ex##riences of my brother that all t#rough the last#t#o#chapter# # and the #urate have been lurking i# t#e#empty house at Ha#liford w#ither#we #led to es#ape the Black Sm#ke. The#e I will#r#sume. We##t#pped there all Su##ay#night and all the next#day--the day of the panic--#n a#little is#and of daylight, cu# o#f b# th# Black Smoke f#om the rest o##the world. We could do nothing but wait in aching ina#tivity during those two#we#ry #a#s. My mind was occupied by anxi#ty for my wif#. I figured her at#Leatherhead, t#rrified, in danger, mou##ing me already as a dead man.

My cou#in I knew #as#brave enough for any#emergency, but he #as not the sort of#man t# realise d#ng## quic#ly# to rise promptly. Wha# was needed n#w#was n#t braver## but circumspection.

But I do not kn#w ##o#these peo#le were, nor#wha# be#am# of#them. We saw n#thing#of#them n#x# day# #he Black Smok# drifted slowly riverward all #h#oug# #o#day morning# creeping nearer##nd n#arer #o us, driving at last #long th# #oadway outsi#e the house#that hid us. # Martian came#a#ro#s t#e f#elds about midday, laying the stu#f wit##a jet of superh#ated ste#m that hissed #gain#t the wa#ls, sm#shed a#l #h# windows it touc#ed,#and ##a#ded the curate's hand as he fle# out of the fro#t #oo#. When at last we #rept across the s#dden rooms and looked o#t a#ain# the country n#rthward was as thou#h a black#sn##storm #ad passed o#er#it. L#oki#g towards the ri#er, we we#e astonished to se# an unaccountable#re##ess min#li#g with the black of the sco#che# mead#ws. For a t#me#we#did no# see how this change aff#cted our positi#n, #ave that we were relieved of our fear##f the Black Smoke. But later I perceived that we were#no#longer hemmed in,#that now we #ig#t get #way. So so#n as I##ealised that t#e way #f escape was open,#my #r#am of acti#n retur#e#. Bu# t#e c#rate was l#thargi## unreasonable# "We #re safe here,"#he#repe#ted;#"safe here."#I resolved t# leave him--wou#d#that I #ad!

And all being quiet #h#ough#u# the aftern#on, we #tarte# a#out five o'clock, as I #h#uld judge, along the blackened road#to Sunbury. In Sunbur#, and#at#intervals a##n# the road, we#e d### bodies ly##g in contorted attitudes, horses as#well #s men,#over#ur#ed ca#ts#and #uggag#, al# covered #hickly with bl#ck #ust.

We went through Bushey Park, with its dee# going to and fro un#e# the ches#nuts, an##some men and women hurrying in the dis#ance towa#ds Hampton# and so we###me t# Twickenham. The#e were the first peo#le we sa#. #way across t#e road the woods beyond Ham a#d Pet##sham were s#i## #fire.

For the mo#t part th#y were like ourselv#s, taking adva##age of a#lu#l to shift th#ir q#ar#ers. I have an impression that many of#the #ouses here were still#occupied by#scared inhabitants, to# frighte#e# e#e##for flight.

Here agai# o# th# Surrey s#de were b##ck dus# #hat had onc# #een smoke,#and #ead #odies--a he## near t## approach to th# s#at#on; but we had no glimpse of#th# Martians #nt#l we w#re s#me way towards Barne#. We saw in the blacke#ed #i#tance a group of thre# people r#nning down a #ide str#e# towards the#riv#r, but otherwise it seem#d deserted. Up#th# hill Richmo#d town #a# bu#nin# briskly;#o##side the town of Richmond #he#e was#no trace of the Black#Smoke. Then suddenly, as we app#oached Kew, came a#number of #eople#ru#nin#, and#the u#perworks#of a Martian #ightin#-machine#l#omed in sight over#th# housetops, not#a#hundred #ards#away from us. We stood aghast at#our danger, and had th# #artian#look#d down we must immediately have p#rished. We were#so terrified that we dared not go on, #ut turned a#id# and hi# #n a#shed in a #ar#en. There t###c#rate crouched, wee#ing silent#y# and ref#sin# to##tir again. B#t #y fixed idea of reaching Lea#herhead#would not #et #e#rest, and in#the twilight I ventured out again. I#went thro##h a shrubbery, and along a passa#e beside a bi# house ##anding in #ts own #rounds, and so#emerged #pon the r#ad towa#ds Kew. Th# cur#te I#left #n #h# shed, #ut he came hurrying after me. Tha# se#ond start was the most f#olhard# #hing I ##er did.

In #h#ee s#rides he was#amon# #hem, and they ran radia#in# #rom his#feet in all directions. He used n# Heat-Ray to destroy them, but##ick#d#them up one by o#e. A##ar#ntly he tossed them into #h# great#meta#lic#carr#e# which projected b#hind him, much as a#w##kman's #asket hangs over his shoulder. It was the fi#s# t#me I realised#that the M##t#ans might h#v# any #the# #urpose#than de#truction with def#ate# humanity# We##tood for a mo#ent petrifie#, then turne# and fled through a gate behind us into a#walled garden##fe#l#into, rather th#n foun#, a fo#tunate #itch, a#d lay ther#, scarce d#ring to whisper t# each #ther unti# the stars #ere out. I suppo#e it was nearly eleven o'clock #efore we gathere# c#urag##t# start again, no l#n#er venturing i#to the#r#ad, but sne#k#ng#alo#g hedgerows and through p#ant#tions, and#watching keenly thro#gh t#e darkn#ss, #e#on th# righ# #nd I on the left, for#t#e#Mar#ians,#who seemed t# be#a#l about us. In##ne place we blundered u#o# a scorched and blackened area,#now#cooling##nd ashen, a#d a numbe# of scatt#red d#ad bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks but #ith their #egs #nd boots mo#tly intac#; and of dead horses# fifty feet, perhaps, behind a line of four ri#ped guns and smashed gun carriages. Sh###, it seemed, #ad escaped destruction, but the #lace was silent and deserted. Here we happened o# no de#d# thou#h the night was to# #ark for us #o#see#into the side roads of the p#ace. In ##een my companion s#ddenly complaine# of fai#tnes# and thirst, and #e decided to try one of #h# h#uses. Th# first house we entered, #f#er a#littl# difficulty#with#the window# was a s#all s#mi#detached villa, and I found not#i#g eatable lef# in the place but s#me moul#y cheese. T##re w#s, however# water to d#ink# and I took a hatchet, which promised to be useful in o#r n##t hous#-breaking. We then crossed to a place whe#e#the road turns to##r## Mor#lake# H#re there stood a white house within a walled garden, and #n the pantry of t#is d#mici#e #e foun# a store of food--two loa#es of bread in a #an, an uncooked steak, and the #alf #f a ham. I give#thi# catalogue so prec#sely beca#se,#as #t h##p#n#d, w# were destine# to subsist upon thi##store for th# next fortnight. Bot#l#d b#er stood##nder a#s#elf, and ther# w#re two bags of haricot beans and some l#mp lettuces. #his pantry opened into a kin# of was#-u# kitchen, an# in this was firewood; #here was also a cupb#ard, in#wh#ch we found#nearly a dozen of burgun##, tinn#d so#ps and salm#n, #nd two tins of biscuits. We sat#in th# adjacent kit#hen in the dark#-for we d#red not ##r#ke a light--and ate bread a#d ham, and d#ank beer out of #he#same bottl#. The curate# who was #till timorous and##es#less, wa##now, oddly#en##gh, #or pu#hing on,#and I #as urging him t# keep up #is st#ength#by eatin# #hen th####ing ha##ened that was to impr#son us# "It can't be#midn#ght yet," I#said, and then ca#e a blinding glare of#vivid green light.

His prop#ecy,#I r#me#be#, appeared in November or December,#1893, in a long-defunct publica##on, t#e Pall Mall Budget, and I re#all a#c#ricature of it in a pre-Martia# periodical call#d Pun#h.

A#d speaking of the differ#nces between the life on Mars and terrestr#al life, I may allud# here t# the#cur#ous suggestions of ##e red weed.

Th# red cr#eper #as qu#te a transitory growth, and few people#have seen it growing. For a time# however, #he red weed #rew w#t# astonishing vig#ur and luxu#iance. It##pr#ad#up #he sides of th# pit b# th# #hird or fourth da# of#o#r im#risonm#nt, and its cact#s-li#e branche# formed a#carmine fr##ge t# the edge# of our tri#ngular w#ndow. A#d afterwards#I found it broadc#st t#roughout the country, and especia#ly wher#ver th#re w#s a stream of#water. The Mar#ians #ad what#appears to h#ve be#n a# #uditory o#gan, a single round drum at the back of the head-body, an# eye# wi#h a visual range not very differ#nt from ours except#that, according to Philips, bl## and #iole# were as bla#k to them. It is commonly supposed that they communica#ed by sounds and tentacular gest#c#lations; thi# is #sser#ed# fo# instance# in the able but h#stily compiled pamphlet written e#ident#y by som##n# not an eye-witne#s#of Ma#ti#n actions#to wh#ch # ha#e#already al#uded, an# which, s# far,#has #een the#chief sour#e#of informa#i#n concerning them. Now n# survivi#g h#man being#saw so much of the Marti#ns in#a#ti#n as I#did. I take no credit to myself for an acci#ent, but th# fact is so. And I ##sert th#t I#watche# them closely t#me after t#me, and that I h#ve s#en four, five, and once#six of t#e# sluggishly performing the most el#b##ately#complicated operations togethe# without eit#e# sound or gesture. Their peculiar#hooting i#var#ably p#eced#d feeding; it h#d n# mo#ulation, and w#s, I believe,#in no sense a#sig#al, but merely the expiration of #ir preparatory to the s#ctional operation.

An# I have been #onvinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions# Be###e #he Martian#in#asion,#as a# #ccasional reader here or there may r#memb#r,#I h#d #ritte# w#th some l#t#le vehemence aga#nst the #el#pa#hic#theo##. Th# Martians wore no clothing.#T#eir conce#t#ons #f #rnament and #ecorum were ne#essa#i#y different #rom ours;#and not on#y were they evidently much les# sensible of ch#ng#s#of tempe#ature than we #re, bu##ch#nges of pressu#e #o not s##m#to#have affected their#health at all seri#us#y. Yet t#ough#they wore no clothing, it was i# the other artificial additions to their #odi#y resources#that their great superiority ove# man lay. We#men, with #u# bicycles and r#ad-skat#s, our#Lilienthal soaring-mac#i#es, our guns and sticks and so fo#th, are ju#t i# the begin#i#g of th# #volution t#at th# Martians have worked #u#.

And in #his connection it is curious t# r#mar# th#t even #n this e#rth Natur# has never hit upon the wheel, or #as preferred #ther #xpedien#s to i#s deve#o#ment.#And not only##id the Martians either n#t know of which is incredible, or ab#tain #rom# the #he#l, but in their a#paratus singularly little #se is made of t#e f#x#d piv#t or re#ativel# fixed pivot, with c#rcul#r motions ther#about confine# to one plane. Almost all the joi#ts#of the machinery#present a complicate# system of slidi## parts moving over#small#but bea#tifully curved fri##ion bearings. And #hile upon this matter of d#t#il, #t is #em#rkable that t#e long#leverages of their machines are in most cases actuated by a #o#t of sham muscula#ure of #he dis#s in an #lastic sheath; t#es# disks become p##ar#sed #nd dr#wn closely and powe#fully #og#ther #hen#travers## by a current of electri#ity. In th#s w#y the curio#s parallelism to animal m#tions, whi#h was#so striking#a#d dist#rbing to the#hum#n b#holder, was attained. Su#h #uasi-muscles aboun#ed in ##e #r#bli#e handling-mac#ine which, on my first pee#ing out of the slit, I wat#hed u#packi#g#the cylinder. It seemed#inf#nitely#more alive than the actual Martians lying beyond #t in the sunset#light, p#nting, stirring ineffect#al ten#acles, a## moving feebl# a#ter their vas# #ourney#across space.

CHAPTER THR#E THE DAYS OF IMPRIS#NMENT The arrival of a seco#d #ight#ng-ma#hine #rove us from our peephole int# the scullery,###r we feared tha# from #i# ele#a#ion th# Marti#n might see down upon us behind our b##rier. At a l#ter#date#we began to #e#l less in danger of ##eir e##s, for to a# eye #n the dazz#e of the sunlig#t outside our ref#ge mus# h#ve b#en#blank #la#kness, b#t at #i#st th# slightest #uggestion of #pproach dr#ve u# into##he #culler# #n #eart-th#o#bing re#r#at. Ye# terrible as #a# the danger we incur#e#, the#attract#on #f #eepin# was for both of us i#resi#tible. And I#reca#l now with a sor# of wonder t#at, in spite of the infinit# danger in whic# we wer# betw#en starvation and a still #or# #errible#de#th, we could yet##truggle bitterly for th#t hor#ibl# pr#v##ege of sight. We would race across the kitchen i# a grotesque way between eagerness and the dread of making a noise, and s#rike each o#her, and thrust and kick,#within a few inches of e##osur#. #he fact is #hat we ##d absolu#ely incom#atible dispo#ition# and habits of thought and action,#and our dang#r an# isolation onl# accentuated #he incompatibilit#. At Ha#liford I had a#re#dy come to hate the curate's trick of #elpl#ss excl#mation, his stupid#rigidity#of mind. His #ndless mut#er#ng monologue viti#ted every effort I m#de to think out a #ine of#ac#ion# an# drove m# at times, thus pe#t up and intensi#ie#, almost ## the#ve#ge of craziness. He #as as lac#ing in restr#int as a silly#woman. He would #eep for hou#s together, and I#v#rily beli#ve t#at to the very end t#is spoiled child #f life th#ught hi# #eak tears in som# way ef#ic#cious.#And I wo#ld sit#in the darkness unable to keep my #i###off him by reaso# of#his im#ortuniti#s###e ate more than I did, #nd it ##s in vain I p#inte# out that our only chance #f li#e was to sto# in the house #ntil#the #artians had done with ##eir pit, th#t #n t#at#long patience a time #ight prese#tly come when we s##uld need food. He ate a#d drank impulsively #n heav# m##ls at long#intervals. He slept little. As the d#ys wore on, his utter carelessne#s #f any consideration s# intensif#ed#o#r dist#ess and danger #hat I had, mu#h#as I loathed doing it, #o resort to threats, and at la#t to blows. That #rought him t# re#son for a time. #ut he w#s #ne of#those weak creatures# #oid of pr#de, timorous, anaemi#, hat#ful souls, full of sh#fty cun#ing, #ho face neither God nor m#n, who face not even themse#ves. It is disagr#eable for me to recall and write these thin#s, but I #et them down that my story#may lack nothing.#T#ose who h#ve esca#ed the dark and terrible as#ects of l#fe will#find my brutality# my flash of r#ge in#our fin#l traged#, ea#y enough#to#blame;#for they #now #hat is #rong as #ell a# a#y,#but not#what is poss#ble to tor#ured men. B#t th#se wh# hav# been under the shadow, who have gone down at la#t to#elem#ntal #hings, will have a#wider char#ty. And while within#we fough# #ut ou# dark, dim conte#t of ##ispe#s, snatc#ed ##od an# dr#nk, a## #ripping hands #nd blows, withou## in the pitiless s#nligh# of tha##t#rrible June, wa###he strange#won#e#, the unfamiliar #outi#e of th# #artians in the pit. Let me re#urn to #hose#fir#t new experience##o# mine. After a long tim# I ventured back to the peephole, to find that t#e#new-come#s had been rei#forced b# the occupants of no fewer than th##e of the fi#hting-machines.#These last had brought with them certain fre#h ap#liances t#at #tood #n an #rderly manner ab#ut the cylinder. The second handling-ma##ine was now co#plet#d, and was busied #n serving##ne of the#novel co#t#iv#nces the#b#g machine#ha# brought# Thi# was a #ody resembling a milk can in ### ge#eral form, above which o#c#l#ated a pe#r-s#aped receptacle, and from which a st#eam of#white powder flowe# into a##ircula# ba#in be#ow.##he oscill#tory motion #as imparted to this by one tentacle of the#handling-machine. With two spatulate hands the handling-ma#hi#e w#s #igging out and flin#ing masses of clay int# the #ear-s#ape# recep#a### a#ove, while w#t# anoth#r arm it #eriodi#ally opened a door and removed rusty a#d blackened clinkers#from the midd#e part of#the machine. An#th#r steely ten#acle directed t#e #owd#r from the b#sin al#n# a ribbed channel#t##ards some receiv#r tha# was hidden from me by the mo#nd of bluish#dust. From th#s unseen recei#er a little thread of green smok# rose vertically #nto the quie# air. #s I #oo#ed, the handlin#-mac#in#, with a fa#nt and musica# clinki##, extend#d##teles#opic f#shion, a tentacle that had be#n a moment before a mere#blunt projection# until its#en# #as #i#den behind#t#e ###nd of clay. In another sec#nd it had lifted#a bar of wh#te aluminium int###ight, untarn#shed #s yet, and #hinin# #azzlingly,#an# d#posit#d it i# a #rowing #tack of#ba#s th## #tood at the side of t#e#pit. Betw#e# sunset an###tarlight this de#terous m#chine must#have #ade more tha# a hu#dred such#bars out of the crude#clay,#and the mound o# blu#sh dust rose stead#ly unti# it topped the s#de of the#pit. Th# co##rast between the swift and comple# movem#nts of th#se contrivance##and#the inert panting c#ums#n#ss of their mast#rs was #cu#e, and#for d#ys I h#d to tell mys#lf repea#ed#y that these ##tter w#re#indeed the living of #he two#t#ings. #he cu##te had possess#on of t#e s#it when the first men were brought to#the pit. I was sit#ing below, huddled up, listening #ith#all my ears. He made a sudden movement backw#rd, and I,#fearfu# #hat we wer# ob#erved, crouche# in a sp#sm #f terror. He came sl#di#g#down the ru#bish a## crep# beside #e in#the darkn#ss, ina#ticulate,#gest#culati#g, and for # moment#I s#ar#d #is panic# #is ges#ure suggested a resignati## #f the slit,#and afte# a li#tle while#my curiosi#y gave me courage# and I rose up, #tepped a#ross h#m,#an# c#ambered#up to it. #t first I cou#d see#no r#aso# f#r#his #ra#tic behaviour. T#e twiligh# had now come, the#sta#s w#re little and fai#t, bu# the p#t was illu#inated by #h##flickering green fire that came from#the#aluminium-making.#Th# #hole pic#ure was a flickering sch#me of green gle#m# and shifti## rus#y bl##k #hado#s, strangely trying to the e#es. Over#and through it all went #he b#ts, heeding#it not at #ll. The spr##ling #art#ans w#re no lo#ge##to be seen, the mound of blue-green powder had risen#to#cover them from sight, and a #ighting-machin## #ith its legs cont#ac#ed, crumpled,#and abbr#vi#te#, stood acro#s th# corner#of the#pit. And then, amid the clangour of the machiner#,#came # #r#f#ing suspicion of h#man voices, t#at#I entertained at first only to dismiss. I crouched##watching this fighting-machine c#osely, satis#ying myself now for the#first time #h#t the #ood did indee# conta#n a Martia#. As the green flames li#ted I could see the #ily gleam#of his integum#nt and##he brightness #f #is #yes. #nd suddenly I heard # yell,##nd saw a lo#g#ten#acle r#aching#over the sh#ulder of the machine to the little cage that hunch#d #p#n its ba#k. Then#somethi#g--s#met#ing strugg#ing ##ol#ntly--#a# li#ted high again#t the sky, a blac#, va#ue enigma against the s#ar#ight; and#as this black object #am# #own a#ain, I saw by the gree# brig#tness that#it was a man.

I could see #is#st#ring eyes #nd gleams of light#on his studs and #atch chai#. He vanished behind the mound, and for a m#men# there was silence. And then began a shr#eking and a sustained a#d cheerf## hooting from t#e Mar#ia#s.

One of its gripping limbs c#rled amid th# debris; anoth#r limb ##pear#d, feeling#its way over#the fallen beams# I sto#d petrif##d, staring.

I turned by a##e###rt, s#umb#ed ov#r the curate, and#s#opped at the sc#llery door. The #e#tacle was now some way, tw# yards or ##re, in the room, and twisting#an# tu#nin#, wi#h #ue#r #u#den mo#ements# this#wa# an# t#at. For a w#ile I stood fascinat#d by t##t slow####tf#l advance.

I en#ount##ed a couple of#hun#ry-looking dogs, but both#hurried circuitou##y away from the adv#nces I mad# them.

I will not#tell the needless troub#e I had brea#in# into that#house#-afterwards I found#the front doo# w#s on the#latch--nor how I ransack#d#every room for food# unti# just on the #erge of despair, #n #ha# se#med t##me to be#a servant's bedroom, I f##nd a rat-gnaw## crust and tw# tin# of pin#apple. Th# place had been already#searched and emptied. In the b#r ##afterw#rds found some b#scuit##and sand#iches that ha# been overlooked. T#e latter I c#uld not eat, they#wer# too rotten, but t#e#former no# only #tay#d my#hunger# but filled my pockets. I lit##o #amps, fearing some Martian might com###eating th#t part of#London for f#od in the night.#Before I went to b#d I ha# an interval##f restlessness, and prowle# fro# wi##o# to window, peering out for#some sign of these#monsters. I slept little. As # lay in bed # #ound myself th#nking con#ecutively--a t#i#g#I do not remember to have done since my last argum#nt#with the ##rate. Duri#g #ll th# #nterve#ing time m# ment#l #ondition had been a hurr##ng succession of #ague emotional #tate# o# a sor# of stupid receptiv#ty.#B#t in the nigh# my#brain,#reinf#r#ed, # suppose,#by th# foo# I had#eaten, grew #l#ar #ga#n, and I th#ugh#. Three t#ings struggled for #ossession of m# m#nd: t#e killing of t#e curate, the whereabout# of the Martians, and#th# possible fate of my wif#. The former ga#e me n# sensation of hor#or or remorse to #ecall; I saw it simply as#a thing#done,## mem#ry inf#nit##y #isagreeable bu# quite without the quality of r#morse. I saw mys##f #hen as I see myself now, driven step #y s#ep#towards that ha##y#blow, the creature #f a s#quence of#acc#de#ts l#ading inevitably to that. I#felt n# condem#a#i#n; ye# the memory, sta#i#,#unprogressive, haunted#me. In the sil#nce #f the night, wit# t#at sense ## the ##arness of God that sometimes comes i#to the stillne#s #nd the darkness, I stood my trial, my only trial, fo# that moment of wrath and fear. I retraced eve#y step o# our conversation from the#mom#nt when I had found him crouching besid# me, heed#ess #f my thi#st# and pointing to th# fire an# smoke that streame# #p#from the r#i#s of Weybridge# We h#d been incapable of co-op#r#tion--g#im chance had#taken#no heed of th#t##Had#I f#r#s#en,#I sho#ld have left him at #allif#rd.

Th#re were #o witnesses--all these things I m#ght have concealed.#But I ### i# down, and the reader #ust form#his judg##n# as he will. And when, by an effort# I had set asi## t#at#picture of a p#ostrate body, I faced the problem of the Martians and the fat##of my wife. For th# form#r ##had no data; I could imagine## hundre##things, and so, u#hap#il## I cou#d for#the #a#ter. An# suddenl# that night became terrible. I found m#s##f sitting up in bed,#starin# at the dark. I f#und mys#lf praying that the He#t-Ray might hav# suddenly #nd p#inless#y str#ck her out of bei#g. Since the#night of my return fr#m Le#therhead I had not p#ayed. I had u#tered pr#yers, fetish pr#ye#s, had praye# as hea#hens ##tte# charm# when I was in #xtremity; b#t now I prayed indee#, pleading stead##stly and sanely, #ace to fa## with the darkn#ss #f God. Strange night!

The morni#g#was bright and fi#e, #nd#the e##tern sky #lo#ed pink, and#was fretted with little golden clouds. In t#e road that runs f#om#the#t#p of Put##y Hill #o Wim#ledon was a number of#poor ves#ig#s of the panic torrent that mus# have poured Londonward on the#S#nday night afte# #h# fighti#g #e#an.

My#movements were#languid, my plans of the va#uest. I h#d an idea of going to Lea#herhead,#though I knew t#at #here I had the poorest chance of fi#ding m# w#f#. #ertainly, unless death had overtaken th#m s#d#enly# m# cousins and#she w#uld have fled thence# but it #eemed to me I m#g#t f### or learn t#er# w#ither the Surre# people h#d fled.

A jeweller#s window had been broken open in one place, but apparently the thi#f had been disturbed, and a number o# gold#chains and a watch lay scattered#on t#e pavement. I did not trouble to touch them. Fart##r on was a tatter#d woman#in a heap on # doorstep; the hand that hung ov#r her knee w#s gashed an# bled do#n her rusty b#own dress, and a smashed magnum of #ha#pagne formed a pool acr#ss the pavement.

I go #o London and see the busy multitudes in#Fleet St#eet and the Strand, and it comes across my#mind that the# ar# but the ghosts#of #he #ast, haunting the street# #hat I have #een#silent a#d wretche#, #oing to and fro, phant#s#s i# a dead ci#y, the mockery of#life in a g#lva#ised body. #nd strange, #oo# it#is to stand on Pri##o#e Hill, as I#did b#t ##day b#fore w#iting this#last c#apter, t# see the g#eat provi#ce of #ouses, dim a#d blue #hrough the ha#e#of#th# s##k# and mist, vanishi#g at last into #he vague#low#r sky, t# see the people##a#king to and fro among #he fl#wer beds on th# hill,#to##ee the #ight-seers about the Ma#t#an machi#e#that s#and# there sti#l, to hea# the tum#lt of playing chil#ren, an# to reca## the time wh#n I saw it a#l bri##t and clear-##t, #ard an# sil#nt, under the dawn of that last great day...
