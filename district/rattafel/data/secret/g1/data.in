The War o# t#e Worlds by H. G. Wells 1898 B#t who sha#l dw#ll in these world# if they be inhabited? ... Are we or they Lor#s of the World? ... And how are al# things made for man?-- KEPLER quoted i# The Anatomy of Melancholy BOOK O#E THE COMIN# OF #HE MART#ANS CHAPTER ONE THE EVE OF T#E WAR N# one wo#ld have believed in #he last years of the nineteent# century that #his world was being watched keenly an# closel# b# intelligences greater than man's an# yet #s mortal as his own; that #s men bu#ied themselves about thei# various #oncerns t#ey #ere scrutinised an# studied, perhaps almost a# narrow#y as a man #ith # microscope might scrutinise the transient creature# that swarm #nd multiply in a drop #f water. With infinite co#placency men went #o an# fr# over this globe a#out their little affairs, seren# i# their assurance of their empire over matter. It #s possible that th# infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as so#rces of human danger, or thought of them only t# dismiss the idea of l#fe upon them a# impossible or improbable. It is curious to reca#l some #f the mental habits of those departed d#ys. At most terrestrial men fancied there mi#ht be other men upon Mars, perhaps #nferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, m#nds th#t are to our minds as ours a#e to those of th# beasts that perish, intellects vas# an# cool #nd unsympathetic, regarded #his earth with envious e#es, and slowly and sure#y drew t#eir plans against #s. An# earl# in the twe#tieth century cam# th# great disillusionment. #he pl#net Mars, I scarcely n#ed remi#d th# reader, revolves about the sun #t # mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and t#e light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by t#is world. I# mu#t be, if t#e nebular hypothesis has #ny truth, older than our world; and long before #his eart# ceased to be molten, lif# upon its surfa#e m#st have be#un its cour#e. #he fact tha# it is scarcely one seve#th #f the v#lume of the earth must h#ve accel#rated its cooling t# the temperature a# wh#ch li#e could begin. It has #ir and water and all that i# necessary for the support of animated existence. #et so #ain is man, #nd s# blinded by his vanity, that no writer, #p to the very end of #he nineteenth cent#ry, expr#ssed any idea that intelligent life might have #eveloped there far, or indeed #t all, beyond its earthly leve#. N#r was it generally understood that since Mars #s older than our earth, with #carcely # qu#rter of the superficial area and remot#r fr#m the sun, #t necessarily fol#ows #hat it i# not only #ore distant from time's beginning but nearer its end. The secu#ar cooling that must someday #vertake our planet has already go#e #ar indeed with our neighbour. Its physical condition is stil# largely a myste#y, b#t we kno# now that e#en in its equator#al regio# #he midday temperature bar#ly approaches that of our coldest winte#. Its air is much more attenuated than o#rs, its #ceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either po#e and periodically inundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which to us is #till incre#ibly remote, #as become # present-day problem fo# the inhabitants of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects, enlarged their powers, #nd hardene# their hearts. And looking across #pace with instruments, and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed o#, they see, a# its nearest distance on#y 35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, # morning star o# #ope, our own war#er planet, green #ith vegetation #nd #rey w#th water, with a cloudy atmosphere el#quent #f fertility, with glimpses t#rough its drifting cloud w#sps of broad stretches of popu#ous country and narrow, navy-crowded seas. And we men, the cr#atures who inhabit thi# earth, mu#t be to them at least as al#en and lo#ly as are the monkeys and lemurs #o us. The intellectu#l side of m#n already admits that life is a# inc#ssant st#uggle for existence, and #t would seem that this #oo i# th# belief of the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gon# i# #ts cooling and t#is worl# is still crow#ed with life, but crowded onl# with wh#t t#ey regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is, in#eed, their only esca#e from the destru#tion t#at, generation after ge#eration, cr#eps upon them. And before we judge #f them #oo harshly we mu#t #emember what ruthless and utte# destruction #ur own species has wrought, not o#ly upon animals, such a# t#e vanished bison and t#e dodo, but upon its inferior races. T#e Tasmanians, in spite of th#ir human likeness, we#e entirely swept #ut #f existence in # war of extermination waged by Euro#ean immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we s#ch apostles of mercy as to co#plain if th# Martians w#rred #n th# same spirit? T#e Martians s#em to have calculated their descent with amazing subtlety--their mathematical l#arning is evidently fa# in excess of ours--and to have carried out their p#eparations wit# a well-nigh perfect unanimity. #ad ou# instruments permitted it, we might have #een the gathering tr#uble far back i# t#e nineteenth century. Men like Schia#arelli wa#ched the red planet--it is o#d, by-the-#ye, that for countless centu#ies Mars has be#n the star of war--but failed #o interpret the fluctuating app#arances of the markings they mapped so well. All t#at #ime the Martians must have been ge#ting ready. During the opposition of 1894 a #reat light was #een o# the illuminated par# of the disk, first at the Lick Obse#vatory, then by Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers. English readers heard of #t first in t#e issue of Nature dated August 2. # am inclined to think that this blaze may have be#n the casting of the #uge gun, i# th# vast pit sunk into #heir plan#t, from which the#r shots wer# fired at us. Peculiar markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site of #hat outbreak during th# next #wo oppositions. The storm burst upon us six years ago now. As Mars approached opposi#ion, Lavelle of Java #et the wires of the astronom#cal exchange palpitating w#th the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak o# in#andescent gas upon t#e planet. It had occurred towa#ds midn#ght of the twelfth; an# the spectroscope, to which he had #t o#ce resorted, ind#cated # m#ss of flam#ng gas, chiefly hydrogen, mov#ng with an enormous #elocity towards this earth. This jet of fir# had become invisible about a quarter past t#elve. He compared i# t# a colossal puff of f#ame suddenly and violently squirted #ut of #he plan#t, "as f#aming gases rushed out #f a gu#." A singularl# appropriate #hrase it proved. Yet the next day there was nothing of this in the p#pers except a little note in t#e Daily Telegraph, and the world we#t #n ignoran#e o# one o# the gravest danger# t#at ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of the eruption at all #ad I not m#t Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer, at Ottersha#. He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess of his feelings invited m# up to t#ke a turn with him that night in a scrutiny of the red planet. In spite of all that has happened since, # still remember that vigil ve#y distinctly: the bl#ck and silent observatory, the #hadowed lanter# throwing a #eeble glow upon the floor in the corner, t#e steady ticking #f t#e clockwork of the telescope, the littl# slit in t#e #oof--an oblong profundity with t#e stard#st streaked across #t. O#ilvy moved #bout, invisible but a#dible. Lookin# through the tel#scope, one saw # circle of deep bl#e #nd t#e l#ttle ro#nd plan#t swimming i# the field. It seemed such a little thing, so bright and small #nd still, faintly mark#d wit# transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from the perfect ro#nd. B#t so little it was, so silvery warm--# pin's-head of ligh#! It was as if it quivered, but really this was #he telescope vibrating with t#e activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view. As # wat#hed, the planet seemed #o gr#w larger and smaller #nd to adva#ce and recede, but that was simply that my eye wa# tired. Forty #illions of miles it was from us--more tha# forty million# of miles of vo#d. Few people realise the immensity #f vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims. Ne#r it i# t#e fie#d, I remember, were three faint points of light, #hree telescopic star# infinit#ly remot#, and all aroun# it was #he unfathomable darkness of empty space. You know how that black#ess looks o# a fro#ty starlight night. In a telescope it seems far profounder. And invisi#le to me because it was so #emote an# small, flying #wiftly and steadily towards me across tha# incredibl# distance, drawing nearer every minute b# so #any thousan#s of miles, came the Thing they were sending #s, the Thing that w#s to bring #o much struggle and c#lamity and death to t#e eart#. # never dreamed of i# #hen #s # watched; no o#e on earth dreamed of that unerring missile. That night, too, there was anothe# #etting out o# gas f#om the dista#t planet. I saw i#. # re#dish flash at the edge, the slightest projection o# th# outline just as the chronometer str#ck midnight; an# at that I told Ogilv# and he took my place. The nig#t was war# #nd I was t#irsty, a#d I went stretching my legs c#umsily and feeling my way i# the darkness, t# t#e little tabl# where #he sipho# stood, wh#le Ogilvy exclaimed at the #treamer of gas that came out towards us. That night anot#er invisible missile started on its way #o the earth from Mar#, #ust a second or s# under twenty-four hours after the first one. I re#ember how # sat on the #able there in #he bl#ckness, with patches of green and crimson swi#ming bef#re my eyes. # wished # h#d a light to smoke by, little suspect#ng #he meaning of the minute gleam I had seen an# #ll tha# #t wo#ld presently bring me. Ogilvy watched till one, and then gave it up; #nd we lit the lantern and walk#d over to his house. D#wn below i# the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people, sleeping in pe#ce. He wa# ful# of speculation #hat night ab#ut the condition of Mars, an# sco#fed at th# vulgar idea #f its having inhabitants who were signalling us. Hi# idea w#s that me#eorites m#ght b# falling in # heavy shower upon the plane#, or that a huge volcanic exp#osion #as in progress. He pointed out to me how unlikely it wa# that or#anic evolut#on ha# taken the s#me direction in the two adj#cent planets. "The chances against anything manlike on #ars a#e a mil#ion to one," he said. Hundreds of observers sa# the flame that night and t#e night a#ter abo#t midni#ht, and ag#in the night after; and #o for t#n nights, # fla#e #ach night. Why the shots ceased after the ten#h no one o# eart# has attempted to explain. It may be the gases #f the #iring caused the Martians inconvenience. Dense clouds of smo#e or dust, visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey, fluctua#ing patches, spread through the clearness of the planet's atmosphe#e and #bscured #ts m#re fa#iliar features. Even #he da#ly papers wok# up to the disturbances at last, an# popular notes appe#red here, there, #nd everywhere concerning the volcano#s #pon Mars. T#e seriocomic per#odical Punch, I rememb#r, made a happy use of it in the po#itical cartoon. And, all unsuspected, t#ose missile# the Martians ha# fired at us #rew earthward, rush#ng now at a pace of many mil#s a second through #he e#pty gulf of space, h#ur by ho#r and day by day, nearer an# nearer. #t seems to me now almo#t incredibl# wonderful that, with th#t swift fate hanging over us, men could go #bout th#ir petty c#ncerns as they did. # remember how j#bilant Markham w#s #t securing a new ph#tograph of the planet for the illus#rated paper he edited in those day#. People in these latter times scar#ely realise th# abundance and enterprise of our ninete#nth-century pa#ers. For my own part, I was much occupied in learning to ride the bic#cle, a#d busy upon # series o# papers discussing t#e probable developments of moral ide#s as civilisation progressed. One night the first missile then coul# scarcely #ave b#en 10,000,000 miles away I wen# for a walk with my wife. It was starlight a#d I explained the #igns o# #he Zodiac #o her, #nd pointed out #ars, a brig#t dot #f light creep#ng zenithward, towards which so many telescopes were pointed. It was a #arm n#ght. Coming home, # party of ex#ursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed u# singing and playing music. There were lights #n the #pper windows of #he houses as the people #ent to bed. From the railway #tation in the #istance came the sound o# shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost i#to melody #y the distance. My wife pointed #ut to me the brightness of the r#d, green, and yellow signal ligh#s hanging in a framework agains# t#e sky. It seemed so safe and tranquil. C#APTER TWO TH# FALLING STAR Then came the night of the firs# #alling #tar. It #as seen early in the morning, ru#hing over Winchester eastward, a #ine of flame hig# in th# atmosphere. Hundreds mus# have s#en #t, #nd taken it fo# a# ordinary falling star. Albin described it as l#aving a greenish st#eak behind i# that glowed for some seconds. Denni#g, our greates# autho#ity on meteorites, stated that the height #f its f#rst appearance was #bout ninety or one hundred miles. It #eemed to him t#at it fell to ear#h about one hundred miles #ast #f him. I was at home at that #our and writing in my study; and although my French windows #ace toward# Ottersha# an# t#e blind was up for I loved in those days to look #p at t#e ni#ht sky, I s#w nothing o# it. Yet t#is strangest o# all #hings that #ver came #o earth from outer space must hav# fallen while I was sitting th#re, visible #o me had I only looked up as it passed. #ome of those wh# sa# its fli#ht say it tr#velled with a hissing sound. I myself hea#d nothing of that. Many people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall #f it, an#, #t most, have thought that a#other mete#rite ha# descended. No one seems to ha#e troubled to look for the fallen mass that night. But very early in #he morning p#or Ogilvy, w#o #ad seen the shooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay som#where on the common between Hor#ell, Otter#haw, a#d Woking, rose early with the idea #f finding it. Find #t #e did, soon after daw#, and not far from the sand pits. An enormous hole #ad bee# made b# the i#pact #f the pr#jectile, a#d #he #and an# gravel #ad been fl#ng violentl# in every direction over the heath, for#ing heaps visible a mile an# a half away. The heather was on #ire eastward, and a t#in blue smo#e rose against the dawn. The Thing itself lay a#most entirely b#ried i# sand, amidst the scatter#d splinters of a fir t#ee i# had shivered to fragm#nts in it# descent. The #ncovered part #ad the appearance of # huge cylinder, caked over and i#s o#tline softened by # t#ick scal# dun-coloured incrustation. It had a diameter of abou# thi#ty yards. He approached the mass, surprised at th# siz# and more so at the shape, since most meteorites are rounded more or less completely. #t was, however, s#ill so hot from #ts flight through the a#r as t# #orbid his near approach. A #tirring noise within its #ylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling of its surface; fo# at that time #t #ad not occurred to him #hat it might be hollow. He r#mained standing at the edge of th# pit that the Thing ha# made for itself, staring at its strange app#arance, astonished chiefly at its unusual s#ape an# colour, and dimly perceiving even t#en some ev#dence of de#ign #n i#s arrival. The early morning was wonderfully still, and t#e sun, j#st clearing the pine t#ees tow#rds Weybri#ge, was already wa#m. He did not remember hearing any birds t#at morni#g, there was certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the faint move#ents from within the cinder# cylinder. He #as al# alon# on the common. Then suddenly he noticed wi#h a start that some of th# grey clinker, the ashy incrustation that covered the me#eorite, was falling off the circular e#ge of the end. It was droppi#g o#f in flakes #nd raining down upon the #and. A large piece suddenly came off and fell with # sharp noise that brought his heart int# his mouth. For # #inute he scarcely realised what #his meant, and, although th# he#t was excessive, he clambered down into the pi# close to the bulk to see the Thing more clearly. H# f#ncied even then that the co#ling of the body migh# account for this, but wha# disturbed that idea was the fact t#at the #sh was falling on#y from the end of #he cylinder. An# then he percei#ed that, very sl#wly, the circular top of the cylinder #as rotati#g on #ts #ody. It #as such a gradual movement that he discovered i# only through notic#ng that a black mark that had been near him fi#e minutes ago was now at the other side of t#e circumference. #ven #hen he scarcely understood what thi# indicated, u#til h# heard # #uffled grating sound and saw the #lack ma#k jerk forward an inch or so. Then th# thing #ame up#n h#m i# # flash. The cylinder was artificial--hollow--with an #nd that screwed out! Som#thing within the cylinder was unscrewing t#e top! "Good heaven#!" #aid Ogilvy. "There's # man in it--men in it! Half roasted to death! Trying to escape!" At once, wi#h a quick mental leap, he #inked the Thing with #he flash upon Mars. The thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to hi# that he fo#got the heat #nd went forward to the cylinder to help turn. #ut luckily the dull radiation arr#sted him before he could burn his hands on the still-glowin# #etal. At that he sto#d irres#lute for a moment, #hen turn#d, scrambled out of the pit, #nd set of# ru#ning wildly #nto Wokin#. The #ime t#en must have been somewhere about #ix o'clock. He met # wag#oner and tried to #ake him understand, but #he tale he told and his #ppearance #ere s# wild--his h#t h#d fallen off in the pit--that th# man simply dr#ve on. He was equally unsuccessful #ith the potman who was just unlocking the do#rs of the public-house by Horsell Bridge. The fellow thought #e wa# a lunatic at large an# made an unsuccessful attempt #o shut him #nto the taproom. That sob#red him a little; and when he saw #enderson, #he London journ#list, in his garden, he called over the paling# and made himself unders#ood. "Hen#erson," he called, "you saw that shooting star last nigh#?" "Well?" said Henderson. "It's out o# Horsell Common now." "Go#d Lord!" sai# Henderson. "Fallen met#orite! Th#t's good." "But it's something more than a meteorite. It's # cylinder--an artificial cylinder, man! An# there's something inside." Henderson sto#d #p with his s#ade i# his hand. "What's that?" he said. He was deaf in one ear. Ogilvy told him all #hat h# had seen. Henderson was # min#te or so tak#ng it in. Then he dropped his spade, snatc#ed up #is jac#et, and came out into #he road. The t#o men hurried back at once to the common, and found the cylinder still lying in the sam# position. #ut now the sounds inside had ceased, and # thin circle #f bright metal #howed between th# top and the bo#y o# the cylin#er. Air was either entering or escaping at th# rim w#th a thin, sizzling sound. They listened, rapped on the #caly burnt metal with a stick, and, m#eting with no res#onse, they both concl#ded t#e man or men inside must #e insensible or dead. O# course the two wer# #uite unable to do anything. They shouted consolation #nd promises, an# went off back to the town again to get help. One can #magine them, #overed #ith sand, exci#ed a#d disordered, running up the little st#eet #n the bright sunlight just a# the shop folks were taking down the#r shutters and peop#e were opening their bedroom windows. Henderson wen# into t#e railway s#ation a# once, i# order to te#egraph the news to London. The newspap#r articles had prepared men's #inds f#r the recept#on of the idea. By eight o'clock a number of boys #nd unemployed men had already started for the common to see the "dead men fr#m Mars." #hat was the form the story took. # heard o# i# first from my #ewspaper bo# about a quarter to nine when I went out to get my #aily Chronicle. I wa# naturally start#ed, #nd lost n# ti#e in g#ing out a#d ac#oss t#e Ottershaw bri#ge to the sand pits. CH#PTER THREE ON HORSEL# COMMON I #ound a little cro#d #f perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge h#le #n which t#e cylinder l#y. # have already describ#d #he appearance #f #hat colossal bulk, embedded i# the ground. The tur# and gravel about it seemed charred as if #y a sudden explosion. #o doubt its impact had ca#sed # flash of fire. Hend#rson an# Ogilvy were n#t there. I think they pe#ceived tha# nothing #as to be done for the present, a#d had gone #way t# br#akfast at Henderson's house. #here were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with their feet dangling, and amus#ng themselves--until I stopped them--by throwing stones at th# giant mass. A#ter I had s#oken to them about #t, they #egan pla#ing at "touch" #n an# out of the #roup of bystanders. Among these were a couple of cy#lists, a jobbing gardener I employed s#metimes, a girl carrying a #aby, G#egg t#e butcher and his little boy, #nd #wo or thr#e loaf#rs #nd golf caddies who we#e accustomed to hang about the ra#lway station. There w#s v#ry little talking. Few of the co#mon peop#e in England ha# any#hing but th# vaguest astronomical idea# in those days. #ost of them were staring quietly at the bi# tabl# l#ke end of the cylinder, which #as still as Ogilvy and Henderson had left it. I fancy t#e popular expectati#n of a heap of charred corpses was disappointe# at th#s inanimate bul#. Some went awa# while I was there, and other p#ople came. I clambered #nto the pi# and fancied I heard a faint moveme#t under my feet. The top h#d certainly ceased to rotate. I# wa# only w#en I got #hus close #o it that t#e strangeness #f this object was at all ev#dent to me. At the first glance i# was really no more exciting than an overturned carriage or # tree blown across the road. Not s# much so, indeed. It loo#ed like a rust# gas float. It required a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the grey scale of the #hing was no commo# oxide, that the yellowish-white metal that gl#amed in the crac# between the lid and th# cyli#der had a# unfamiliar hu#. "Extra-terrestrial" had no meaning for most of the onlookers. At tha# #ime it was quit# clea# in my ow# mind that the Thing had come from th# planet Mars, #ut I judged it improbable that i# contained any living creatu#e. I thought the unscrewing might be automatic. In spite of Ogilvy, I still believed that there were men in Mars. My mind ran fancifully on the possibilities #f its containing manus#ript, on t#e difficulties in trans#ation that might arise, whether we should find coins and models in it, #nd #o forth. Yet it was a little too large f#r assurance on this idea. # felt an impatience to see it opened. Abo#t eleven, as nothing #eemed happening, I wa#ked back, f#ll of su#h thought, t# m# home in Maybury. But I found it difficul# to #et to work upon my abstract inve#tigations. In the afternoon the #ppearance of the com#on had al#ered very much. The earl# editions of the #vening papers had startled London with enorm#us headlines: "A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS." "REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING," and so for#h. In addit#on, Ogilvy's wire to the Astronomic#l Exchange had r#used every obser#atory in the three kingdoms. There were hal# a dozen fl#es or more from the Woking station standing in the road by the sand pits, a baske#-chaise from Chobham, and a rather l#rdly carriage. Besides that, there was quite a heap of bicyc#es. In addition, a lar#e number of people must have walked, in spite #f the h#at of the day, from W#king and Ch#rtsey, so that there was altogether quite # considerable crow#--one or two gaily dressed ladie# among the others. It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor # breath of wind, and the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine tr#es. The burning #eather had #een extinguished, but the level ground towards Ottershaw #as blackened as far a# o#e co#ld see, and still gi#ing off vertical streamers of smoke. An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer #n the Chobham Road had sent up #is #on with a bar#ow-load of green apples and ginger beer. #oing to the edge of the pit, # f#und it occupied by a group of about half # dozen men--Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man that # afterwards learned was Ste#t, the Astronomer R#yal, with several workmen wielding spades and picka#es. Stent was giving directions in a cle#r, high-pitched v#ice. He was standing on the cylinder, wh#ch was now evidently much cooler; his face was cri#son and streaming with pe#spiration, #nd something s#emed to ha#e irri#ated h#m. A lar#e portion of the cylinder h#d b#en uncovered, though its lower end was still embe#ded. As soon as Ogilvy saw me amo#g the staring crowd #n #he edge of the pit he called t# me to come down, and asked m# if # w#uld mi#d going over #o see Lord Hilton, the lord of the m#nor. The growing crowd, he sa#d, was becom#ng # serious i#pediment to their excavation#, especially the boy#. They wanted a light railing p#t #p, and he#p to keep the people back. He told me #hat # faint stirring was occasionally still audible within the case, bu# that the wo#kmen had faile# to unscrew the top, as it afforded n# grip to the#. The cas# appeared to be enormously thi#k, #nd it was possible that the faint so#nds #e heard represente# # noisy tu#ult in the interior. I was very glad to do as he as#ed, and #o #ecome one o# the privileged spectators within t#e contemplated enclosure. I failed #o f#nd Lord Hilton a# #is house, but I was told #e was expected from London by the six o'clock train from Waterloo; and as it w#s then about a qu#rter past five, # we#t home, had so#e tea, a#d walk#d up to t#e station to waylay him. CHA#TER FO#R THE CYLINDER OP#NS Whe# I returned to the common the sun was se#ting. Scatte#ed groups w#re hurrying #rom t#e direction of Woking, and one or two persons were returning. The crowd about t#e p#t had increased, and stood o#t black again#t the le#on yellow of the sky--a couple of hundred peopl#, perhaps. There were rai#ed voic#s, a#d some sort of struggle appeared to be going on abou# the pit. Stran#e imaginings passed thr#ugh my mind. As I dr#w nearer I heard Stent's voice: "Keep back! Keep back!" A boy came running towards m#. "It's a-movin'," he said to me as he passed; "a-screwin' and a-screwin' out. I #on't like it. I'm a-goin' 'ome, I am." # went #n to #he crowd. There were really, I should think, two or three hundred people elbowi#g an# jostling one another, the one o# two ladies there being #y no means the least active. "He's fallen in the pit!" cried som# one. "Kee# back!" said sev#ral. The crowd swayed a little, and # elbowed my way through. Every one seemed greatly excited. # hea#d # peculiar humming sound from the pi#. "I say!" said Ogilvy; "h#lp keep these idiots back. We don't know what's in th# confounded thi#g, you kn#w!" I sa# a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he wa#, standing on the cylinder and trying t# scramble o#t o# the hole again. The crowd had pushe# hi# in. The end of t#e cylinder was being screwed out from within. Nearly #wo feet of shining screw projected. Somebody blundere# against me, and I narrowly missed being pitch#d onto th# to# of the screw. I turned, a#d as I did s# the scr#w must have come out, for the lid of the cylinder fell upon the gravel with a ringing c#ncussion. I stuck #y e#bow into the person be#ind me, a#d tur#ed my head towar#s t#e Thing agai#. For a mom#nt that circular c#vity #eemed perfectly black. I had the sunset in my eyes. I think everyone expected #o see a man emerge--possibly something a l#ttle unli#e us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man. I k#ow I did. But, looking, # presently s#w something stirring within the shadow: #reyish billowy movemen#s, one above another, and then two #uminous disk#--like #yes. Then something resembling a little grey snake, about the thicknes# of a walking stick, coil#d up out #f the writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me--and then another. A sudden chill came over me. There was a loud shriek from # woman behind. I half turned, keeping my eyes fi#ed u#on the cylinder s#ill, from which other tentacles w#re now projecti#g, and began pushing #y way back f#om the edg# o# the pit. I saw astonishment givi#g place to horror on the faces of the people about me. I heard inarticulate exclamations on a#l sides. There was # general movement ba#kwards. I saw th# shopm#n struggling stil# on #he e#ge #f the pit. I found myself alone, and saw the people on t#e other side of the pit running off, Stent among them. I looked ag#in at the cylinder, #nd ungovernable terror gripped me. I stood petrifi#d and staring. A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, #f a b#ar, was ris#ng #lowly an# painfully out of t#e cylinder. A# it bulged u# a#d caught the light, i# gli#tened lik# we# leather. Two large dark-coloured eyes were regard#ng me steadfastly. T#e mass that framed them, the head of the thing, w#s rounded, #nd h#d, o#e might say, a face. There was # mouth u#der the eyes, the lipless brim of which quivered and pant#d, and dropped s#liva. The w#ole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gr#pped the ed#e of the cylinder, another swayed in the a#r. Th#se who have never seen a #iving Martia# c#n scarcely imagi#e the strange horror #f its appearance. The peculiar V-#haped mouth with i#s pointed upper lip, th# #bsence #f bro# #idges, the absence of a #hin beneath the wedgel#ke lower lip, th# incessant qu#vering of this mouth, the Gorgon groups of tentacles, #he tumultuous b#eathing of the lungs in a strange atmosphere, the evid#nt heavines# and painfulness of movemen# due to the greater gr#vitational energy of the earth--above all, the extraordinary inten#ity of t#e immense eyes--were at #nce vital, intense, inhuman, crippled an# monstrous. There #as someth#ng fungoid #n the #ily brown skin, something in the c#umsy del#beration of the tedio#s movements unspeakably #asty. Even at this fi#st encounter, this first glimpse, I #as overcome with disgust and dr#ad. Suddenly th# mon#ter van#shed. It had toppled o#er the brim o# the cylinder and fallen into the pit, with # thud like #he fall of a great mass of leath#r. # heard it giv# # #eculiar thick c#y, and forthwith another of these creatures appeared darkly in the #eep shadow of the aperture. I turned and, run#ing madl#, made for t#e first group of trees, perhaps a #undred y#rds away; but I r#n slantingly an# #tumbling, for I could n#t a#ert #y f#ce from these things. There, amo#g some young p#ne trees and fu#ze #ushes, I sto#ped, pa#ting, and waited further developments. The #ommon round the sand pits wa# dotted with p#ople, standing li#e myself in a ha#f-fascinated terror, staring #t these creatures, or rathe# at the heaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay. And then, with a renewed horro#, I saw a round, black object bobb#ng up and down on the edge #f #he #it. It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in, but sho#ing as a little black object a#ainst the hot western sun. Now he got his shoulder a#d knee up, a#d agai# he seemed t# slip back until only his head was visible. Suddenly he v#nished, and # could have fancied a faint shriek had reached me. I had a momentary impulse t# go back #nd help #im that my fears overruled. E#erything was then quite invisible, hidden by the dee# pit and th# heap #f sa#d that the fall of the cylinder ha# made. Anyone coming along the road from Chobham or Woking would have been ama#ed at t#e sigh#--a dwin#ling mult#tude of perhaps # hundred peopl# or more standing in a great irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes, #ehind gate# and hedges, saying little #o one another and that #n #hort, excited shout#, and staring, st#ring hard at a fe# heaps o# sand. The barrow o# ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black against th# #urning sky, and in the sand pits #as # row of deserted vehicles with their horses feeding o#t of nosebags or pawing the ground. CHAPTER F#VE T#E HEAT-RAY Af#er the glimps# I had had o# the Martian# emerging from #he cylinde# in which they had come to the earth fro# their planet, # kind #f fascination paralysed my actions. I remained standing knee-deep in the heather, stari#g at the mound that hid them. # w#s a battlegroun# of fear and curiosity. I did n#t dare to go back towards the pit, b#t I felt a passionate l#nging to peer into it. I be#an walking, therefore, in a big curve, seeking some po#nt of vantage and conti#ually looking at the san# #eaps that hid these new-comers to our earth. Once a leash of thi# black whips, like the arms of an oc#opus, flashed across the sunset and was immediately withdrawn, and afterwards # thi# rod rose up, j#int by joint, bearing #t #ts ap#x a circula# disk that s#un with # wobbling motion. What could #e going on there? Most of #he spe#tators ha# gathe#ed in one or two groups--one a little crowd towards Woking, th# other a #not of people in #he direction of Chobham. Evidently they sh#red m# mental conflict. There were few near me. One man I approached--he was, I perc#ived, a neighbour of mine, t#ough I did not know hi# name--and accosted. But it was scarcely a time for articulate conversation. "What #gly brutes!" he said. "Good G#d! W#at ugly brutes!" He repeated this over and #ver again. "Did you see a man in the pit?" I said; but he made no an#wer #o t#at. #e beca#e silent, and #tood watching for # time side by side, deriving, I fancy, a certa#n com#ort in one another's company. Then # shifted m# position to a little kn#ll th#t gave me t#e advantage of a yard o# more of elevation a#d when I looked for him pres#ntly he #as walking towards Woking. The sunset faded #o twi#ight before anything further #appened. The crowd far a#ay #n the left, #owards Woking, seemed to grow, an# # h#ard now a f#int murmur from it. T#e #ittle kn#t of people towards Chob#am dispe#sed. T#ere was scarcely an intimation o# mov#ment from the pit. It was this, as much as anything, that gave people #ourage, an# I suppos# the #ew arrivals fro# W#king also helped to restore #onfidence. At any rate, as the du#k came on a s#ow, inte#mittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather for#e as the stillness of #he evening about th# cylinder remained unbroken. Vertical blac# #igures in #wos and threes would advanc#, stop, watch, and ad#ance again, spreading o#t as #hey did s# in # thin i#regular crescent that promised #o enclose the pit in i#s attenuated horns. #, to#, on my #ide began t# mo#e towards th# p#t. Then # saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoof# and #he gride of w#eels. I saw a lad trundling off the barro# of ap#les. And then, within thirty yards #f #he pit, advancing fr#m the directio# of Horsell, # noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of w#om was wav#ng a white flag. T#is was the Deputation. There ha# been a hasty consultation, and s#nce the Martians were evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms, intelligen# creatures, it had b#en resolved t# sho# them, b# approaching them with signals, #hat w# too were intelligent. #lutter, flut#er, went t#e flag, first to the right, th#n to the left. I# was too far for me to recognise anyone there, #ut afterwards I learned that Ogilvy, St#nt, and Henderson were with others in this attempt a# communication. This little group had in its advanc# dragged inward, so to speak, the circumfer#nce #f #he now almost complete circle of people, and # #umber of di# black figure# followed it a# disc#eet distances. Suddenly there wa# # flash #f light, an# a qu#ntity #f luminous greenish smoke came out of t#e pit #n three distinct puffs, which drove up, on# after t#e other, straight into the still a#r. This smoke #r flame, perhaps, w#uld be #he better word for it was #o bright that the deep blue sky overhead an# the h#zy stretches of brown common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seeme# to darken abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain #he darker afte# their dispersa#. A# the sam# time a f#int hissi#g sound became audible. Be#ond the pit stood the litt#e wedge of people with the white flag at #ts apex, arrested by th#se phenomena, a little knot of small vertical black shapes upo# the black ground. As the green smok# arose, the#r faces flashed out pallid green, and f#ded #gain as it vanished. Then slowl# the hissing passed into # #umming, into a long, loud, droning noise. Slowly a hu#ped shape #ose out of the pit, and the ghost of a beam of light s#emed to flicker out from it. Forthwith flashes o# actual flame, a brigh# glare le#ping fro# one to another, sprang from #he scattered group #f m#n. It was as #f some invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into #hite flame. It wa# as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turne# to fire. Then, b# th# light of their #wn destruction, I #aw th#m staggering and falling, and their supporters turning to run. # stood star#ng, #ot as yet re#lising that this wa# d#ath l#aping from ma# to man i# #hat little distant c#owd. All I felt wa# tha# it was something very strange. An almost noiseless and blinding flash o# light, and a man fell h#adlong and lay still; and a# the unseen #haft of heat passed over them, pin# trees burst into #ire, and every dry furze bush became wit# one dul# thud # mass of flames. And far away towards Knaphill I saw #he flashes of trees and hedges and wooden buildings suddenly set alight. I# was swe#ping #ound swift#y and steadily, this flaming death, this invisible, inevitable swor# of #eat. I perceived it coming tow#rds me by the flashing bushes it touch#d, and was too astounded and stup#fied to #tir. # heard t#e crackle of fire #n the san# pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as #uddenly stilled. The# it was as #f an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heat#er betwee# me and #he Martians, and all along a curving line beyond #he sand pits the #ark ground sm#ked a#d c#ackled. Something #ell with a crash #ar a#ay to th# left where the road from Woking station opens out #n the common. Forth-w#th the hissing #nd hu#ming cea#ed, and the black, dome-like object sa#k slo#ly out #f sight into the #it. #ll this had happened with such swiftness #hat I had stood m#tionless, dumbfounded and dazzled by th# flashes o# light. Had that death #wept through # full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in m# surprise. But it passed and spared me, and lef# the night a#out m# sudden#y #ark and un#amiliar. The undulating common se#med #ow d#rk almost to blackness, except where its roadways la# grey an# p#le under the deep blue sky of the early nigh#. It was #ark, a#d suddenly void of #en. Overhead the stars were musteri#g, an# in the west the sky was #till # pale, bright, almost greenish blue. The tops of the pine trees and the roofs of Ho#sell came out sha#p an# black against th# west#rn afterglow. The Mar#ians and #heir appliances were altoge#her invisible, save for th#t thin mast upon whic# their restless mirror wobb#ed. Patches #f bu#h a#d isolated trees he#e a#d there smoked and glowed still, and th# houses towards Woking s#ation were sending u# spires of flame into th# stillness #f th# evening air. Nothing was changed save for that and # terrible astonishment. The little group #f bla#k specks w#th the flag of white had been swept out of existence, a#d #he stillness of the even#ng, so i# seemed to me, had scarcel# been broken. It came to me that I #as upo# this dark common, he#pless, unprotected, and alone. Suddenly, li#e a thing falling upon m# from without, came--fear. Wit# an effort # #urned an# began a s#umbling run th#ough the heather. The fear # felt was no r#tional fear, but a pan#c terror not onl# of the Martia#s, but #f the dusk and stillness #ll abo#t me. #uch an extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that # ran weeping silently as a child might do. Once I had turned, I did not dare to #ook back. I remember I #elt an extraordinary persuasion that I was being played with, that presently, wh#n # was u#on the very verg# of safety, this mysterious death--as swift as the passage of light--would leap after me from the pit about t#e #ylinder and strike me down. C#APTER SIX THE HEAT-RAY IN THE CHOBHAM ROAD I# is still # matter of w#nder how the Martians are a#le t# slay men s# swiftly and so silently. Ma#y th#nk that in #ome way they are able to generate an intense h#at in a chamber of practically absolute non-conductivity. This in#ense heat they p#oject in a parallel beam #gainst any object they choose, b# means o# # polished parabolic mirror of unknown composition, much #s th# para#olic mirror #f # lighthouse projec#s # beam o# l#ght. But no one has absolutely proved these de#ails. However it is do#e, it is certain that a beam o# heat is the essence of the #atter. Heat, and in#isible, instead of visible, light. Whatever is combustible fla#hes in#o flame at its touch, lead runs like water, it sof#ens iron, crack# and melts glass, and when i# falls upon water, #ncontinently that explodes #nto steam. That night nearly forty people lay under the starligh# about the pit, cha#red and distort#d beyond recognition, and all night long the common from Horsell to Mayb#ry was deserted and brightly ablaze. The news o# the massacre probably reached Chobham, Woking, and Ottershaw about the same time. In Woki#g the shops had closed when the tragedy happened, and a number o# people, s#op peo#le and so forth, attracted by the st#ries they had heard, were walking ov#r the Horsell Bridge and al#ng the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon the common. You #ay imagine the young peo#le brushed u# after the labours o# the day, and making this #ovelty, #s they would make any novelty, #he excuse for walk#ng together and e#joying a trivial flirtation. You m#y figure to yourself th# hum of voice# al#ng #he road i# the gloaming... As yet, of course, few pe#ple in Woking even knew that th# cylinder had opened, though p#or Henderson #ad se#t a messenger on a bicyc#e to the post office with # sp#cial wire to a# evening paper. As these folks came out by t#os #nd threes upon the open, they found little knots of people talking excite#ly and peering at t#e spinning mirror #ver the sand pits, and #he newcomers wer#, no doubt, soon infec#ed by the excitement of #he occasion. By half past eight, when t#e Deputation was destroyed, there may have been a crowd o# three hundred #eople or more a# this place, besides those #ho h#d left the road t# approach the Martians nearer. There were three p#licemen too, one #f whom was mounted, doing their be#t, under instructi#ns from Stent, to keep the #eople back and deter them fr#m approaching t#e cylinder. Ther# was some booing from #hose mor# thought#ess and excitable so#ls to w#om a crowd is always an occasion #or noise and horse-play. Stent and Ogilv#, antic#pating #ome possibilities of # collision, had t#legraphed from Horsell to the barracks as #oon as the Martians emerged, for the help of a compan# of soldiers to protect these strange creatures #rom violen#e. After that they returned t# le#d that ill-fated advance. T#e descript#on of their death, as it was seen by the crowd, tallies v#ry closely with my own impression#: the three puffs of gree# smoke, the deep humming note, and th# flashes of flame. #ut #hat crowd of people had # far na#rower escape than mine. Only the fact that a hummoc# of heathery sand intercepted th# lower par# of the Heat-Ray saved them. Had #he elevation of t#e parabolic mirror been a few yards higher, none could have lived to tell the t#le. They saw the flashes and #he men falling and an invisible hand, a# it were, li# the bushes a# it hur#ied towards the# through th# twil#ght. Then, with # whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit, t#e beam swung cl#se over their heads, ligh#ing t#e to#s of the beech trees that line t#e #oad, and s#litting the bricks, smashin# t#e windows, firing the window frames, and bring#ng down in crumbling #uin a portion o# the gable #f the house n#arest the corner. In the sudd#n thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees, #he panic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some moments. #parks and burning twig# bega# to fall #nto the road, and single leaves #ike puffs of flame. Hats and #resses caught fire. Then ca#e a crying from #he common. There w#re shrieks an# shouts, and suddenly a #ounted policeman came galloping through the confus#on with hi# hands clasped over his head, sc#eaming. "They'#e coming!" # woman shrieked, and incontinent#y everyone w#s turning and pushing at those behind, in order to c#ear their way to Woking again. They must have bolted as blindl# #s a flock o# sheep. Where the ro#d grows narrow and black between the high b#nks the #rowd jammed, and a desperate struggle occurred. All t#at crowd did not escape; three pe#sons at least, two wo#en and a little #oy, were crushed and tram#led there, and left to die amid #he terror and t#e darknes#. CHAPTER SEVEN HOW I REACHED HOM# #or my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress of blundering against #rees and stumbling through t#e heather. A#l about m# g#thered #he invisi#le terrors o# t#e Martians; that #itiless sword of heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead befor# it descended and smote me out o# l#fe. # came int# the road between the crossroads and Horsell, a#d ran along this to the crossroads. At last I could go no further; I #as exhausted with the violence #f my emotion a#d of m# flight, #nd I staggered and fell by #he wayside. Th#t was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the #asworks. # fell and la# still. I must have remained there some time. I sat up, strangely perplexed. For a moment, perhap#, I could no# clearly understand how I came there. My terror ha# f#llen f#om me like a gar#ent. My hat had gone, #nd my collar had burs# away from i#s fastener. A few minutes before, there had only been thre# real things be#ore me--the #mmensity of the night and sp#ce and nature, my ow# feebleness and anguish, and the near approach of death. Now it was as i# something turned #ver, and #he po#nt #f view altered abruptly. There #as no sensible transition from o#e state of mind t# the other. I was #mmediately the self o# every #ay again--a decent, ordinary citizen. The silent commo#, the impulse of my flight, the starting #lames, were as if they #ad been in a d#eam. # asked myself had t#ese latter th#ngs indeed happened? # cou#d not credit it. I rose #nd walked unsteadily up the steep inclin# of the bridge. #y mind w#s b#ank wonder. My muscles and nerves seemed drained of their #trength. # dare say # stagger#d drunkenly. A head rose over t#e arch, an# #he figure of a workman carrying # b#sket appeared. Beside him ran a little boy. #e passed me, wi#hing me good night. I was minded #o speak to him, but d#d no#. I #nswered his greeti#g wi#h # meaning#ess mumble and went on over the bridge. #ver the M#ybury arch # train, # billowing tumult o# w#ite, fi#elit smoke, and a long caterpillar o# lighted windows, went fly#ng south--clatter, clatter, clap, rap, #nd it had gone. A dim gr#up o# people talked in th# gate of on# of the houses in the pretty little #ow of gables that w#s called Oriental Terrace. It wa# all so real #nd so familiar. And t#at behind me! #t was frantic, fantastic! Such things, I told myself, could not be. Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods. I do not know how far my experience i# common. At times I suffer from the strangest sense o# #etachment from myself and the worl# about me; # seem to watch #t all from the outside, from somewhere inconcei#ably remote, out of time, o#t of space, out of th# stress a#d t#agedy of it al#. This feelin# was ve#y strong #pon me #hat night. Here was anothe# side to #y dream. But the trouble #as the blan# inco#gruity #f this serenity and the swift death flying #onder, not two miles away. There was a noise of business from th# gasworks, and the electr#c lamps were #ll alight. I stoppe# at the group of people. "What new# from #he common?" said I. There #ere two m#n and a woman at the gate. "Eh?" said o#e of the men, turning. "What ne#s from the common?" I said. "'Ain'# yer just been there?" asked the men. "Peopl# se#m fair sill# about t#e common," said the w#man #ver the gate. "#hat's it all #bart?" "Haven't you heard #f t#e men from Mars?" said I; "t#e creatur#s from Mars?" "Quite enough," said the w#man over the gate. "Thenks"; and all three of them laughed. # felt foolish and angry. I #ried and found I c#uld #ot tell them wha# I had see#. They laughed again a# my broken se#tences. "You'll hea# more yet," I said, and went o# to my home. I startled my w#fe at the doorway, #o haggard was I. I went into the dining roo#, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I could collect myself sufficiently I told he# t#e things I h#d #een. The dinner, whi#h wa# a cold one, had already been served, and remained neglected o# the table while I told #y s#ory. "Ther# is one thing," I s#id, t# alla# t#e fears I had aroused; "they are t#e most sluggish things I ever saw crawl. They #ay keep the pit an# kill people #ho come near them, but they cannot get out o# it... But the horror of them!" "Don't, dear!" said my wife, knittin# her brows and putting her hand o# mine. "Poor Ogilvy!" I said. "To t#ink he may be lying dead there!" My wife #t least did not find my experience incredible. When I saw how deadly white her f#ce was, I ceased abruptly. "They may come h#re," s#e said #gain and again. I pressed h#r #o take wine, and tried to reassure #er. "They can scarcel# move," I said. I #egan to comfort #er and myself by repeating a#l that Ogilvy had told m# of the impossibility o# the Martians establishing themselves on the earth. In particular I laid stre#s #n the gravitational difficulty. On th# surface o# the earth t#e force of gravit# is three time# wha# it is on th# surfac# of Mars. # M#rtian, therefore, would weigh three times more than on Mars, albeit hi# muscular stre#gth would be the sa#e. H#s own body w#uld be # cope of lead to #im. That, indeed, was #he general opinion. Both The Times an# the Daily Telegraph, for instance, insisted on it the next morning, #nd both overlooked, just as # d#d, two obvious modifying influences. Th# atmosphere o# the earth, we now know, contains far m#re oxygen or far l#ss argon whichever way one likes to put it than do#s Mars. The invigorating influences of th#s excess of oxyge# up#n the Mart#ans indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased w#ight #f their #odies. And, in the second place, w# all overlo#ked the fact that such mechanic#l intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite able #o dispense with musc#lar exertion at # pinch. But I did not consider these points #t the time, and #o m# reasoning was dead against the chances of the invaders. With win# and food, the confidence of m# own ta#le, a#d the necessity of reassuri#g my wife, # grew by insensible degrees coura#eous and secure. "They have done # foolish thing," said I, fingering my wineglass. "T#ey are dangerous because, no doubt, they are m#d with t#rror. Perhaps #hey expected #o fin# no living things--certainly no intelligent living things." "# shell i# the pit" said I, "if t#e w#rst c#mes #o the wo#st will ki#l them all." The intense excit#ment of the events had no doubt left m# perceptive powers in a state of erethism. I rem#mber t#at dinner table with extraordinary vividne#s even now. #y dear wife's swee# anxious face peering at m# #rom under the pink lamp shade, the white cloth #ith #ts s#lver and glass table furniture--for in those days even philosophical w#iters had many little luxuries--the crimson-purple wine i# m# glass, ar# photographically #istinct. At the end of it I sat, tempering nuts with a cigarette, regretting Ogilv#'s rash#ess, a#d denouncing the shortsighted timidity of th# Martians. So #ome res#ectable dodo in the Mau#itius migh# have lorded it in his nest, a#d discussed the arrival o# that shipful of pitiless sail#rs in want of animal food. "We wil# pec# them to death tomorrow, my dear." # #id not know it, but t#at was the last civilised dinne# I was t# eat for very many s#range an# terrible days. CHAPTER EIGHT FRIDA# N#GHT The most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange a#d wonderful thi#gs that happened upon that Friday, #as the dovetailing of #he commonplace habits of #ur s#cial order with the first beginnings of t#e ser#es of eve#ts that was to topple that social order headlong. If on F#iday night you had taken a pair of compasses a#d drawn a circle w#th # radius of fi#e miles round t#e Woking sand pits, I doubt #f you would have had one human being outside it, unless it were some relation #f Stent or of the thr#e or four c#clists o# London people lying dead o# the common, who#e emotions or h#bits were at all affected by the new-comers. Many people #ad heard #f the cylinder, #f #ourse, and talked about it in their leisure, bu# #t certainly did not #ake the sen#ation t#at #n ultimatum #o Germany would have done. I# London that night poor Henderson's telegram describing the gradual unscrewi#g o# the shot was judged to be # canard, and his e#ening paper, a#ter wir#ng for au#hentication from him a#d re#eiving no reply--the man was kill#d--decided not to print a specia# edition. Even within the five-mile circle the great majority of people #ere inert. I have already described the behaviour of the men and women to wh#m # spoke. All over th# #istrict people w#re din#ng and supping; #orking men were gardening after the labours of the day, children were be#ng put to bed, youn# people were wandering throu#h the lanes love-making, students sat over the#r b#oks. #aybe t#ere was a murmur in the vi#lage streets, a novel and dominant topic in the public-houses, a#d here and there a mes#enger, #r even #n eye-witness of the later occurrences, caused # whirl #f excitement, a shouting, and a running t# and fro; but f#r the mos# p#rt the daily routi#e #f working, eati#g, drinking, sleeping, wen# on as it had #one fo# countless years--as though no planet Mars e#isted in the sky. Even at Wokin# stat#on an# Horsell and Chobha# that was the case. In Woking junction, until a late hour, trains we#e stopping and go#ng on, others we#e shun#ing on the siding#, passengers were alighting and waitin#, and everything wa# proceeding in t#e most ordinary way. # boy from the town, trenching o# Smith's monopoly, was selli#g papers with t#e afternoon's news. The ringin# impa#t #f trucks, th# sharp whistle of the engines from the junction, mi#gled w#th their shouts #f "Men from M#rs!" Excited men came i#to the station a#out #ine o'clock with incredible tidings, #nd caused no more d#sturbance th#n d#unkards might #ave done. #eople ratt#ing Londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows, and sa# only a #are, flickering, vanishing s#ark dance u# from the direction of Horsell, a re# glow and # thin ve#l of smoke driving across the stars, an# thought t#at noth#ng more serious than a heath #ire was happening. It wa# only round the edge of the common th#t an# disturbance was perce#tible. #here were half a doz#n villas bu#ning on the Woking border. There were lights i# al# the houses on th# common #ide of the three villages, and the people there kept awake till dawn. A curio#s crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and go#ng but the crowd remain#ng, b#th on the Chobham and Horsell bridges. One o# t#o adventurous souls, #t was afterwards found, went into the darkness an# crawled quite nea# the Martians; but they never returned, for now and again a light-#ay, lik# the #eam of a warship'# searchlight swept the common, and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow. Save for such, that big area of common was silent and desolate, and the charred bodies lay about o# i# #ll night under the stars, and #ll the next day. A noise #f hammerin# from the p#t was h#ard by many people. So you hav# the #tate of things on Friday night. #n the centre, sticking into t#e skin of our old pl#net Earth like a poisoned dart, #as this cylinder. But #he poison was scarcely working yet. Around it was a patch of silen# common, smouldering in places, and with a few dark, di#ly seen objects lying in c#ntorted attitudes h#re and there. Here an# there was a burning b#sh or tree. Beyond was a fringe of excitement, and farther than th#t fring# the inflammati#n had not crept as yet. In the rest of the #orld the stream of l#fe still flowed as #t ha# fl#wed for immemorial year#. The fev#r of w#r that would presen#ly clog vein and arte#y, deaden nerv# and destroy #rain, had still to develop. A#l #ight lon# #he Martians were hammering and #tirring, sleepless, indefatigable, at work upon th# ma#hines they were making ready, and ever a#d agai# a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the #tarlit sky. About eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell, and deployed along the edg# of the common to form # co#don. Later a second company marched through Chobham to deploy on the north side of the comm#n. Several officers from the Inkerman barracks had b#en on the common earlier in the day, and one, Majo# Eden, was reporte# to be missing. The colonel of the regiment c#me t# the Chobham bridg# and was #usy questioning the crowd at midnight. The military authorities were certainly alive to the s#riousness of the business. About eleven, the next morning's papers wer# able to say, # squadron of hussars, #wo Maxims, and about fou# hundred men of th# Cardigan regim#nt st#rted from Alde#shot. A few seconds after midn#ght the crowd in the C#ertsey road, W#king, saw a star fall fro# heaven into the p#ne woods to the northwest. It had a greenish colour, and #aused a silent brightness lik# summer lightning. This was t#e s#cond cylinder. CHAPTER NINE THE FIGHTING BEGIN# Saturday live# #n #y memory as a day #f suspense. It was a day of lassitude too, #ot and close, with, I #m told, # rapidly fluctuating barome#er. I had slept but #ittle, though my wife had succeeded in sleeping, an# I rose early. # went into my garden before br#akfast and stood listening, bu# towards the common there was nothing stirring but a lark. The milkman #ame a# usual. I #eard the rattle of hi# chariot and I went #ound to the side gate to a#k the latest news. #e told me that during th# ni#ht the Martians had #een surrounded by troops, and that guns were expected. Then--a familiar, reassuring no#e--I heard a tr#in runnin# towards #oking. "They aren't to be killed," said the m#lkman, "if that c#n possibly b# avoided." I sa# #y neighbour gardening, chatted with him f#r a time, and then strolled in #o breakfast. It was a most unexceptional morning. My neighbour was of opinion that #he troo#s woul# b# able to capture or to destroy the Martians during th# day. "It's a pity they make themselves so unapproachable," #e said. "#t would be cu#ious #o #now how they #ive on #nother planet; we might #earn # th#ng or two." He came up to #he fence a#d extended # hand#ul of strawberries, fo# his gardening was as generous as #t wa# enthusiastic. At the sam# time he t#ld me of the burning o# t#e pine woods about th# Byfleet Golf Links. "They say," sai# he, "that there's another of those blessed things fallen the#e--number two. But #ne's enough, surely. This lot'll co#t the insurance people a pretty penny b#fore everything's settled." He laughed with #n a#r o# the greatest good humo#r a# he said this. The woods, #e said, were st#ll burnin#, and pointed out a haze of smo#e to m#. "They will be hot #nder foo# for days, o# account of the thick #oil of pine needles and turf," he said, and then grew serious over "po#r Ogilvy." Afte# breakfast, instead of working, # decided to walk down towards the common. #nder the railway bridge I found a group of soldiers--sappers, I think, me# i# small round caps, dirty red j#ckets unbuttoned, and s#owing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and boot# coming #o the calf. They told me no on# was allowe# o#er the canal, #nd, l#oking along t#e road towards the bridge, I saw o#e o# the Cardig#n men standing s#ntinel there. I #alked with t#ese soldiers for a tim#; # told the# of #y sight of the Martians on the previous evening. None of them had seen the Mart#ans, and t#ey h#d but t#e vaguest id#as of them, so that they p#ied me with questions. They sai# that they did not know who had aut#orised the movements of th# troops; their idea w#s t#at a d#spute had arisen at the Horse Guards. The ordinary sapper is a grea# deal better educa#ed th#n #he common soldier, and the# discussed the pecu#iar conditions of the possible fight with some acuteness. I describ#d #he Hea#-Ray #o th#m, and they beg#n t# argue among themselves. "Crawl up under cover and #ush 'em, say I," #aid one. "Get aht!" sa#d another. "What's #over a#ainst this 'ere 'eat? Sticks to coo# yer! #hat we #ot to d# is to go #s near as th# ground'll let u#, and then drive a trench." "Blow yer trenches! You always #ant trenches; you ought to ha' been born # rabbit Snippy." "Ain't #hey got any necks, th#n?" #aid # third, #bruptly--a little, contemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe. I repeated my d#scription. "Octopuses," sa#d #e, "that's what I calls 'em. Talk about fishers of men--fighters of fish it i# this time!" "It ain't no murder kil#ing beast# like that," said the fi#st speaker. "Why not shell the darned things s#rite off and finish 'em?" said the little dark man. "You carn tell wha# they mig#t do." "W#ere's your shell#?" said th# #irst sp#aker. "There a#n't no time. Do it in a rush, that's #y ti#, and do it at once." #o they discussed it. After a while I le#t them, #nd wen# on to the railwa# station to get as m#ny morning pape#s as I could. But I will not weary the reader #ith # description of that long morning and o# the longer afternoon. # did n#t succeed i# gettin# # glimpse of the com#on, for eve# Horsell a#d Chobham church towers were in the han#s of the mi#itary authorities. The soldiers I addressed didn't know anything; the officers were mysterious as well #s busy. I #ound people in the town quite secure again #n the presence of the military, and # heard for the first time fro# Marshall, the #obacconist, that his so# was among the dead on the #ommon. #he soldiers had m#de the peopl# on the outskirts o# Horsell lock up and #eave their houses. I got back t# lunch about two, v#ry tired for, a# # have said, the day was extremely h#t and dull; and #n order t# refresh #yself I too# a cold bat# in the after#oon. About half past #our I #ent up to the railway station #o get #n evening paper, #or the morning papers #ad contained only a very inaccurate descr#ption o# the killing of Stent, Hende#son, Ogilvy, and the others. B#t there was little I didn't know. The Martians did not show an in#h of themselves. They seemed busy in their pit, and there was # soun# of hammering and an almost continuous stream#r of smoke. Apparently they were busy getting ready for # struggle. "Fresh attempts have been mad# to signal, bu# without success," was the stereotyped formu#a #f th# papers. A sapper tol# me #t #as don# by a #an in a dit#h wi#h # flag on a long pole. The Martians to#k as much notice of s#ch advances as we should of the lowing of a co#. I must confess the sight of all this armament, all th#s preparation, greatly excite# me. My #magination became be#ligerent, and defe#ted the invade#s i# a doze# striking ways; something of my school#oy dreams of battle and heroism c#me back. It ha#dly seemed # fair fight to me a# that ti#e. They seemed very helpless in that pit of the#rs. About three o'cloc# there b#gan th# thud o# a #un at measured intervals from #hertsey or Add#estone. I learned that the smouldering pine wood into #hich the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled, in the hope of destroying that object before #t op#ned. It was only about five, h#wever, that a field gu# reached Chobham #or use against the first bod# #f Martia#s. About six in the evening, as # #at at tea with my wife in the summerhouse #alking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon us, # heard a muffled de#onation from the common, and immediately after # gust #f firing. Close on the heels of that came a violent rattling c#ash, quite close to us, that shook #he ground; and, starting out upon the lawn, # #aw the tops #f the trees a#out the Oriental College bur#t into smoky red flame, and the tower of the little church be#ide it slide down int# #uin. The pinnacle of the mosque had vanishe#, and #he ro#f l#ne #f th# college itself looked as if a hun#red-ton gun had been at work upon #t. O#e #f our chimneys cracked #s #f a s#ot had hit it, fle#, and a piece o# #t came clattering down the t#les and made # heap of broken red fragments upon #he flower bed by my study w#ndow. I and my w#fe stood amazed. Then I realised tha# the crest of Maybur# Hill must be #ithin range o# th# Martians' Heat-Ray now that #he college w#s cleared out of #he way. At that I gripped my w#fe's arm, and without ceremony #an her out #nto the road. Then I fetched #ut th# servant, t#lling her # would #o upstairs myse#f fo# t#e b#x she was clamouring for. "We c#n't possibly #tay here," I said; an# as I spoke the firing #eopened for a moment upon the c#mmon. "Bu# where are we to go?" said m# wife i# terror. I tho#ght perplexed. Then # remembered her cousins at Leatherhead. "Leatherhead!" I shouted #bove #he sudd#n noise. Sh# looked a#ay #rom me downhill. #he people were coming ou# of t#eir houses, astonished. "How ar# we to ge# to Leatherhead?" she said. Down the hill # #aw # bevy of hu#sars ride #nder the railway bridge; three galloped t#rough the o#en gates of the Oriental Col#ege; two #thers dismounted, an# began running from hous# to h#use. The sun, shining through the smoke that drov# up #rom the tops of the trees, seemed blood red, and threw an unfamiliar #urid light upon everything. "St#p here," said I; "y#u are safe here"; and I started off #t once f#r the Spotted Do#, for I kn#w the l#ndlord had a h#rse #nd dog cart. # ran, for # perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the hill w#uld be moving. I found him in his bar, quite una#are of what was going on behind hi# house. # ma# stood with his back to me, talking #o him. "# mus# have a pound," s#id t#e landlord, "a#d I've n# one to #rive it." "I'll give you #wo," said I, o#er t#e stranger's shoulder. "What for?" "And I'll #ring it b#ck #y midnight," # said. "Lord!" said the landlor#; "what's t#e hurry? I'm selling #y #it of a pig. Two pou#ds, and you bri#g it back? What'# goi#g o# now?" I explained hastily that I had to le#ve #y home, and so secured the dog cart. At the time it did not seem t# me nearly #o urgent that the la#dlord sh#uld leave his. I took care #o ha#e the cart there and the#, drove i# off #own the ro#d, and, leaving it in charge of my #ife and servant, rushed into my house a#d packed a fe# valuables, such plate a# w# had, and s# forth. The beech trees below th# house #ere burning while I did this, #nd #he palings up the road glowed red. #hile I was occupie# i# this way, one of the dismoun#ed hussars came running up. He was going from house t# ho#se, warn#ng people to leave. He w#s going on as I came out #f my f#ont door, lugging my treasures, do#e up #n a tablecloth. # shouted after #im: "#hat news?" H# turned, stared, bawled something #bout "crawling out #n a thing like a dish cover," and ran #n #o the gate of the house a# the crest. A sudden whirl of black smoke dri#ing a#ross #he road hid him for a moment. I ran t# #y neighbo#r's door a#d rapped to satisfy myself of what I already knew, t#at #is wife h#d gone t# London with him and had locked up their house. I went in again, according #o my promise, to get my servant's box, lugged it out, clapped #t beside her on the tail of the do# cart, a#d th#n ca#ght t#e reins and jumped up int# the driver's seat beside my wife. In another moment we were clear of #he smoke and noise, #nd sp#nking down th# opp#site slope of Ma#bury Hill towards Old Woking. In front was # quiet sunn# landscape, a wheat field ahead on either side of the r#ad, and the M#ybury Inn with it# swinging sign. I #aw t#e doctor's cart #head of m#. At the bottom of the hill I turned #y head to look at th# hi#lside I #as leaving. Thick streamers o# black smoke shot with threads of red fi#e we#e dr#ving #p into the still air, and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetop# eastward. #he smoke already extended far a#ay to t#e east and west--to #he Byfleet p#ne woods eastward, and t# Woki#g on #he west. The #oad w#s dotted w#th people running t#wards us. A#d #ery faint now, but very distinct throu#h the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that was #resently sti#led, #nd an intermittent cracking of rifles. Ap#arently the Martian# were setting fire to everything within range of their Hea#-Ray. I am not #n #xpert driver, and I #ad immediately to turn my attention #o the horse. When I looked back aga#n the second hill had hid#en the black smoke. # slashed the horse with the whip, and gave him a lo#se rein until Woking #nd Send lay be#ween us and that quivering tumult. I overtook a#d passed the doctor between Woking an# Send. CHAPTER TEN IN THE STORM Leatherhead is ab#ut twelve miles from Maybury Hill. Th# scent of hay was in the air thro#gh the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and #he h#dges #n either side were sweet #nd gay with multitudes of dog-r#ses. The heavy firing #hat had broken out while we were dr#ving down Maybury H#ll ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving t#e evening very peacefu# and still. We #ot to Leat#erhead withou# misadventure about nine o'clock, and the horse had an hour's rest while I took supper with m# cousins and #ommended my wife to their care. #y wife was curiously s#lent thr#ughout t#e drive, an# seemed oppressed with forebodings #f evil. # talked to he# reass#ringly, pointing out that the #artians wer# tied to #he Pit by sheer heaviness, a#d at the utmost could bu# crawl a littl# out of it; but she answered only in monosyllables. Had it not #een for my promise to th# innkeeper, she wo#ld, I thi#k, have urged me to stay in L#atherhead that night. Would that I had! Her face, # remember, w#s ver# white as we parted. For my own part, I had been feverishly excited all da#. Som#thing very like the war fever that occasionally r#ns through a civilised community had got in#o my blood, and i# my heart I was not s# ver# sorry that I had to #eturn t# Maybury tha# night. # was even afraid that that l#st fusillade I had heard might mean #he extermin#tion of our invaders from Mars. I can best express m# sta#e of mind by s#ying that # wanted to b# in at #he death. It was nearly eleven w#en # st#rted t# #eturn. The night was unexpectedly dark; to me, walking ou# of the lighted passage o# my cousins' house, it see#ed indee# black, and it was as ho# and close as t#e day. Overhead the clouds were driving #ast, a#beit #ot # #reath stirr#d the shrubs about us. My cousins' m#n lit both lamps. Happily, # knew the road intimately. My wife #tood in the light of th# doorway, a#d watche# me until I jumped up #nto the dog cart. Then abruptly she turned an# went in, leaving my cous#ns side #y side wishing me good hap. # w#s a little depressed at first with the co#tagion of my wife's fears, but very soon #y th#ughts #everted to the Martians. At t#at ti#e I was absolutely in the dark a# to the course of the evening's fighting. # did not kno# even #he circumstanc#s that h#d precipitated the conflict. As # #ame thr#ugh Ock#am fo# that was t#e way I returned, and not through Send and Old Woking # saw along the western horizon a blood-red g#ow, which #s I drew nearer, crept slowly #p the sky. The d#iving clouds o# the gathering thunderstorm mingled there with masses of #lack #nd #ed smoke. Ripley Street w#s deserted, and except for a lighted window o# so #he village showed not a sign of life; bu# # narrowly escaped an accident a# #he corner of t#e road to Pyrford, where a knot o# people stood #ith their bac#s to me. #hey said not#ing to me as I passed. I do not k#ow w#at they knew #f #he things happening beyon# the hill, no# d# I know i# th# silent houses I passed on #y way were sleeping s#curely, or deserted an# empty, #r harassed and watching a#ainst the terror of t#e night. #rom Ripley until I came through Pyrford I #as in the valley of the Wey, and #he red glare was hidden from me. As I ascended the little hill beyond Pyrfo#d Ch#rch the glar# came into view again, a#d the trees ab#ut me shivered with the fir#t intimation of the stor# that wa# upon #e. Then I hea#d m#dnight pealing out from Pyrford Church behind me, an# th#n came the #ilhouette of Maybury Hill, with its tre#-tops and roofs black and sharp agains# the #ed. Eve# as I beheld this a lurid green gl#re lit the road abo#t me and showed the distant woods towards Addlestone. # felt a tu# a# #he #eins. I saw that the driving cl#uds had been pierced a# it w#re by a thread of green fire, su#denly lighting their confusion an# falling into the field to my left. #t was the third fa#ling star! Close on its apparitio#, and blindingly vio#et by c#ntrast, danced out the first lightning of the gatherin# storm, and the thunder burst l#ke a rocket overhead. The horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted. A moderate inc#ine runs towards the #oot of Maybury Hill, a#d down this w# clattered. Once the lightning had begun, i# went on in a# rapid # succession of flashes #s I have ever #een. The thunderclaps, tr#ading one o# the heels of another an# with # strange crackling accompaniment, sounded more like #he working of # gigantic electric machine than #he usual detonating reverberati#ns. The flickering light was blinding a#d con#using, and a thin ha#l smote gustily at m# face as I dro#e down the slope. At first I regar#ed lit#le but the r#ad before me, and then abruptly my attention was arrested by something t#at was moving rapidly down t#e opposite slope of Maybury Hill. #t first I to#k it f#r the #et roof o# # house, but #ne fl#sh following another #howed it to be in swift rolling movement. It #as a# elusi#e vision--a moment of bewildering darkness, an# t#en, i# a flash like daylight, the red mass#s of the Orphanage near the cres# o# the hill, the green t#ps of the pine trees, and this pro#lematical objec# came out clear and s#arp and bri#ht. And this Thing I sa#! H#w can I describe it? # monstrous tripod, higher than many houses, striding over th# y#ung pine trees, and smash#ng them aside in i#s c#reer; a walking engine #f glittering met#l, striding now across #he heather; articu#ate ropes of stee# d#ngling from it, and th# clattering tumult o# its passag# mingling wi#h the riot of the #hunder. A flash, and i# came #ut vividly, heeling over one way wit# two feet #n the air, t# vanis# and reappea# almost instantly as i# seemed, with the nex# flash, a h#ndred yards nearer. Can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground? That was th# impression those instant flashes gave. But instead of # milking stool imag#ne it a great b#dy of machinery on a tripod stand. Then suddenly the #rees in the pine wood ahead of me we#e parted, as #rittle reeds ar# parted by a man thrusting through them; they we#e snapped off and driven headlon#, and a second hu#e tripod appear#d, rushing, as it #eemed, headl#ng towards me. And # w#s galloping har# to meet it! At the sight of the second m#nster my nerve went altogether. N#t st#pping to l#ok a#ain, I wrenched the horse's he#d hard round #o the right and in ano#her m#ment the dog cart had #eeled over u#on the horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was #lung side#ays an# fel# heav#ly into a shallow p#ol #f water. I crawled out almost immediately, and #rouched, my fe#t still in the water, #nder a clump of furze. The horse lay motionless his neck was broken, poor brute! and by t#e lightning flashes I saw t#e black bulk o# th# overturned dog cart and the silhouette o# the wheel #till spinn#ng slowl#. In another moment the colossal mechanism went striding by #e, and passed uphill toward# Pyrford. See# nearer, the Thing w#s incredibly strange, for it wa# no mere insensate machi#e driving #n its way. Machine it was, with # ringing metallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles one of which grip#ed a young pine tr#e swinging and rattling about its strange body. It picked its road as it went stri#ing #long, and the brazen h#od that surmounted it mo#ed to and fro with the inevitab#e suggestion of a head looking about. Behind th# main body #as a hug# mass o# white #etal like a gigantic fis#erman's basket, and #uffs of green smoke squirted out #rom #he #oints of the limbs #s the monster swept by me. And #n a# instant it was gone. So much I saw th#n, all vaguely for #he flickering o# t#e lightn#ng, in blinding highlights a#d dense bla#k shadows. As it passed it set up an exultant deafening #owl th#t drowned the thunder--"Aloo! Aloo!"--and i# another minute it was with its companion, half a mile away, stooping over somet#ing in t#e fiel#. I have no doubt this Thi#g in the field #as the third of the ten cylinders they had fired #t us fr#m Mar#. For some min#tes I lay th#re #n the rain and darkness watching, by #he intermittent light, these monstrou# beings of metal mo#ing about in the distance over the #edge tops. A #hin ha#l was no# beginning, a#d a# i# came and we#t their fi#ures grew misty and then flas#ed into clearne#s #gain. Now and then came # gap #n th# lightning, and the night swallowed them up. I was soaked with hail abov# and puddle water bel#w. It wa# so#e time befor# my blank astonishment w#uld let me struggle #p the bank to a drier position, or think at all of my imminent peril. #ot far from me was a little #ne-roomed squatter's hu# of wood, surrounded #y a #atch o# potato garden. I struggled to my feet at las#, and, crouching and making u#e #f every chan#e of cove#, I mad# # ru# for this. I hammered at the door, but # could #ot make the people h#ar if th#re were a#y #eople inside, and after a ti#e # desisted, and, #vailing myself of a ditch for #he gre#ter part of the way, succeeded in crawling, unob#erved by these monstrous machines, into the pine woods towards Maybury. Under cover of th#s I pushed on, wet and shivering now, t#wards my own house. I walked among the trees t#ying to find the footpath. It was v#ry da#k #ndeed in the wood, for the lightning wa# now becoming infrequent, and th# hail, which was pouring down in a torrent, fe#l #n co#umns through #he gaps in the heavy foliage. If I h#d fully realised the meaning of #ll the things # had seen I should have immediately worked my way round through Byfleet to Street Cobham, and so gone bac# to rejoin my wife #t Leather#ead. But that night th# stran#eness of things ab#ut me, and my physical wretchedness, prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to th# s#in, deafened a#d blinded by th# storm. I had a vague idea of going on to my own hou#e, and that was a# much motive as # had. I staggered through the trees, fell into a di#ch and bruised my knees against # plank, and finally splashe# ou# into the lane that #an down fro# the College Arms. I say splashed, for t#e storm wa#er #as sweeping #he sand down the hi#l #n # muddy torrent. #here in th# darkness # man blundered into me an# sent me r#eling back. He gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and rushe# on #efore I could gather #y wits sufficiently to spea# to him. So heavy was the st#ess of the storm ju#t a# this #lace that I had th# hardest task to win my way #p the hi#l. I went close #p to th# fence on the left and work#d my way along it# palings. Near the top I stumbled upon something so#t, and, by # flash of lightning, s#w between my feet a heap of bla#k broadcloth an# # pair of boots. Before # #ould distinguish clearly h#w th# man lay, the flicker of light had passed. I stood over him waiting for the next f#ash. When #t came, # saw that he was a sturdy man, cheaply bu# not shabbily dressed; his head was bent under his body, and he la# cr#mpled up close to the fence, as though he had been flu#g violently agains# it. Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who #ad never before touched a dead body, I stooped and turned him o#er to feel fo# his heart. He was quite dead. Apparently his n#ck had be#n broken. The lightn#ng fla#hed for a t#ird t#me, and hi# face leape# upon me. I sprang #o my feet. It was t#e landlord of the Spotted D#g, whose conveyance I had taken. I stepped ove# him gingerly and pu#hed on up #he hill. I ma#e my way by the police station and t#e College Arms to#ards my own house. Nothing was burning on the hillside, though from the common there still came # red glare and # rolling tumult o# ruddy smoke beating #p against the drenchi#g hai#. S# #ar as # could see by the fl#shes, #he houses abou# me were mostly uninjured. By t#e College #rms a dark heap lay i# #he road. Down the road #owards Maybury Bridge the#e w#re voices and t#e sound o# feet, but # h#d not the c#urage to s#out or to go to them. I let myself i# with m# latchkey, closed, locked and bolted the door, stagg#red #o the foot of the staircase, and sat down. My imagination w#s #ull of those striding metallic monsters, and of the dead body smashed against the #ence. I crouched at t#e foo# of t#e staircas# with my back #o the wall, shivering violently. CHAPTER ELEVEN AT THE WINDOW # have already said that my storms #f emotion h#ve # trick o# exhausting themselves. After a time # discovered that # wa# cold and #et, and wi#h little poo#s of water a#out me on th# stair #arpet. I go# up alm#st mechanically, went into the dining room an# drank #ome whiskey, a#d then # was moved to change my clothe#. After # had done that I went upstairs to my study, but why I did #o I do not know. The window of my study looks over th# trees and th# railway towards #orsell Common. In the hurry of our departure this window had been left open. Th# passage was dark, an#, #y contras# with the picture the window frame enclose#, the si#e of the r#om se#med impenetrably dark. I stopped short in the doorway. The thunderstorm had passed. The towers of the O#iental College and the pine trees about it #ad gone, and v#ry far aw#y, lit by # #ivid red glare, the common abou# the sand pits was visible. Across #he li#ht hu#e black shapes, grotesque and strange, moved busily to and fro. I# seeme# indeed as if the whole country in that direct#on was on fire--a broad hillside set with minut# tongues of flame, sway#ng and writhing wit# the gusts of the dying storm, an# throwing a red reflection upon the cl#ud-scud above. Every now and then a haze of smoke fr#m so#e nearer conflagration drove across the w#ndow and hid the Martian shapes. I could not se# what they were doing, nor the clear form of them, nor recognise the black objects they wer# busied upon. Neither could I see the nearer fir#, though #he reflections of it danced o# the wall and ceiling of the #tudy. # sharp, resinous #ang of #urning #as #n the air. I close# the door #oiselessly and crept towar#s t#e window. As # did so, #he v#ew op#ned #ut until, on the one hand, it reached #o #he houses about Woking station, and #n t#e other to the charred and blackened pin# woods of Byfleet. Ther# was a light d#wn below the hill, on the railway, near the arch, and s#veral of t#e ho#ses along the Maybury ro#d and the streets near #he station were glowing r#ins. Th# light upon the railway puzzled me #t fi#st; there we#e a black heap and a vivid glare, and to #he right of that # row of yellow oblongs. Then I perceived #his wa# a wrecked train, the fore part smashed and on fire, th# hinder carriages still #pon the rails. Between these three main centres of light--t#e houses, th# tra#n, and the burnin# count# towards Cho#ham--stretched irre#ular patches o# dark country, broken here and there b# interva#s of dimly gl#wing and smoking ground. It was th# strangest spectacle, that black expanse set with fire. #t reminde# #e, more than anything else, of the Potteries at nigh#. At first I could dis#inguish no people at all, though # peered intently for them. Later I saw against #he light of Woki#g sta#ion # numbe# of black figures hur#ying on# after the other a#ross the line. And this was the li#tle world in which I had been living securely for yea#s, #his fiery chaos! Wh#t #ad happened #n the last seven hours I st#ll did not know; nor did I kno#, though # wa# beg#nning to guess, the relation between th#se mechanical colossi and the sluggish lumps # h#d seen disgorg#d from the cylinder. With a queer feeli#g o# imperso#al interest # turned m# des# chair to t#e window, sat down, an# stared at the blackened country, #nd particularly at #he three gigantic black things that were goin# to and fro #n the glare about the sand pits. #hey seemed amazingly busy. I be#an to #sk myself wha# th#y could be. Were they intelligent me#hanisms? Such # th#ng I felt was impossible. Or did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing, usi#g, much as a man's b#ain sits an# rules in #is body? I b#gan #o compare the t#ings #o human machines, t# ask myself for the first time in #y #ife how an ironcl#d #r # steam engine would seem to #n intelligen# lo#er animal. The storm #ad left #he sky clear, and over th# smok# of the burning l#nd the little fading pinpoint of Mars #as dro#ping into the west, #hen a soldi#r came into m# garden. I heard a slight scraping at the fenc#, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had #allen upon me, I looked down a#d saw #im dimly, clambering over the palings. At the s#ght #f ano#her human being my to#por passed, and I leaned out #f the window eag#rly. "Hist!" said I, i# a whisper. He stopped astride of the fence in doubt. Th#n he came over and across the lawn to th# corner of #he ho#se. He be#t down and s#epped softly. "Who's there?" h# said, al#o whispering, standing under the window and peering up. "Where are you going?" I asked. "God knows." "Are you trying to hide?" "That's i#." "Come into the house," I #aid. # went down, unfastened the door, and l#t him #n, and locked the door again. I could no# see his face. He was hatless, #nd his coat was unbuttoned. "My God!" he sai#, as I drew him in. "#hat has happened?" # asked. "What hasn't?" In #he obscurity I could see he made a gestu#e o# despair. "They wip#d us out--simply wiped us out," he repeated again and again. He followed me, almost mechanicall#, in#o the dining r#om. "Tak# some whiskey," # said, pouring out a stiff dose. He drank it. T#en abruptly he sat down before the t#ble, put his head on his arms, and began to sob and w#ep like a little b#y, #n a perfect passion #f emoti#n, while I, with a c#rious forgetfulness of m# own recent despair, stood b#side him, wondering. It #as # lon# time before h# could steady hi# nerves to answe# my questions, an# then he answe#ed p#rplexingly and b#okenly. He wa# a driver i# the artillery, and had on#y come into action about seven. At that #ime firing was going on a#ross the common, and it wa# said #he first party of Martians were crawling slowly towards their second cylinder und#r cover of a met#l shield. Later this shield staggered u# on tr#pod legs and became the first of the f#ghting-machines I had seen. The gun h# drove had been unlimbered near H#rsell, in order to command the sand pits, and its arrival i# was that ha# precipitated the #ction. As the limb#r gunners w#nt to the rear, hi# horse #rod in a rab#it hole and came down, throwin# h#m into a depression of the ground. At the same momen# th# g#n exploded behind h#m, the ammun#tion blew up, the#e was fire all about him, and he found himself lying under # heap of charred dea# men and dead horses. "I lay still," he s#id, "scared out of m# wits, wi#h the fore quarte# of a horse atop #f #e. We'd been wiped out. An# the smell--good God! Li#e burn# #eat! I #as hurt across the back by th# fa#l of the horse, and there I had to l#e until I felt better. Just like par#de it had b#en a min#te before--then s#umble, ban#, swish!" "Wiped out!" h# s#id. He h#d hid under the dead horse f#r a long time, peeping out furtively ac#oss the common. The C#rdigan men #ad tri#d a rush, in skirmishing order, at the pit, simply to be swept out o# existence. Then the monster had risen to i#s feet and h#d begun to walk leisurely to #nd fro acr#ss th# c#mmon amo#g the few fugitives, with its h#adlike hood turning about exactly li#e the head o# a cowled human being. # #ind of arm carried a complica#ed metallic case, about which gre#n flashes scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smoked #he Heat-R#y. In a f#w minutes there was, so f#r as th# sold#er could se#, not a living #hing left #pon the common, a#d e#ery bush and tree upon it that was not already a b#ackened skeleton was burning. T#e hussars had been o# the road beyond the cur#ature of the groun#, and he s#w nothing of them. He heard t#e Martia#s rattle for a time and then become #till. #he giant saved #oking station and its cluster of houses unt#l the last; then in a mom#nt the Heat-Ray was brought to bear, and #he town became a heap of fiery ruins. Then the Thing shut of# the Heat-Ray, and turning its back #pon #he artill#ryman, began to wad#le #way towa#ds the smouldering pine woods th#t sheltered the second cylinder. As it d#d so # second glittering Titan built it#elf up out of the pit. The second monster followed the first, and at that the artilleryman began to cr#wl very cautiously across t#e hot h#ather ash towards Hors#ll. He managed to get alive into the ditch by the #ide of th# road, and #o escaped #o Woking. Th#re hi# story becam# #jaculatory. T#e place was impassable. It seems there were a few people a#ive th#re, frantic #or #he mo#t part and #any burn#d and scalded. #e was turned asi#e by the fire, and hi# am#ng #ome almost scorching heaps of broken wall as one of the Martian giants returned. He saw this one pursue a man, catch him up in one of its steely ten#acles, and knock his he#d again#t the trunk of a pin# tree. At last, after nightfall, the artilleryman made a rush for #t and got over the railway embank#ent. Since then he had been skulking alo#g towards #aybury, in t#e hope of getting out of danger London#ard. People #ere hiding in tre#ches and cellars, a#d m#ny of the survivors had made of# towards Woking village and Send. He had been consumed with thirst until #e fou#d one of the wa#er mains near #he #ailway arch smashed, and the water bubbling out #ike a spring upon the road. That was the story I go# from him, bit #y bit. He gre# calmer telling me and trying to make me see the things he had seen. He had eaten no food since midday, he told me early #n h#s narrative, and I fou#d some mutton and bread in th# pantry and brough# #t #nto the room. W# lit #o lamp for fear #f attracting the Martians, an# ever and ag#in our hands would to#ch up#n bread o# meat. A# he talk#d, thin#s about us came darkly out of th# dark#ess, and the trampled bushes and bro#en rose trees outside the window gr#w distinct. It #ould see# that a number of men or animals had rushed across the lawn. I began to se# his face, blackened and haggard, a# no doubt mine was also. Wh#n w# had finished e#ting we went softly u#stairs to my study, and I looked again out of the op#n window. In #ne n#ght #he va#ley h#d become # valley #f ashes. The fires had dwindle# now. Where flames h#d been there #ere now s#reamers of smoke; but the countless ruins of shattered and gutt#d h#uses a#d blasted and blackened trees that the night had hidde# stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of daw#. Yet here and there #ome object had had the luck to escape--a white railway signal here, the end of # greenhouse th#re, white a#d fresh amid the wreckage. Never before in the history of w#rfare #ad destruction been #o #ndiscriminate and so u#iversal. And shining with t#e #rowing li#ht of the east, three of the metallic giants stood about the pit, their cowls rotating as thoug# they w#re surveying the desolation they had mad#. It seeme# t# me that the pit h#d been enl#rged, and ever and again puffs of viv#d green v#pour streamed up and out #f i# towards the brighten#ng dawn--streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished. Beyond were the pil#ars of f#re about Chob#am. They became pillars of bloodshot smo#e at the first touch of day. CHAPTER TWELVE WHAT I SAW OF #HE DESTRUCTION O# WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPER#ON As th# dawn grew brighter we withd#ew fro# the window from which we had watched the Martians, and went very quietly downstair#. The artilleryman agreed with me that th# house was no pla#e to stay i#. He prop#sed, he said, #o m#ke his w#y Londonward, and thence rejoin his battery--No. 12, of t#e Horse #rtillery. My pl#n was #o return at o#ce to Leatherhead; and s# #reatly had the str#ngth of the Martians impressed #e th#t # had determined to take my wif# to Newhaven, and go wit# #er out of the country forthwit#. Fo# # already perceived clearly that the countr# about London must inevitably #e the #cene o# # disastrous struggle before such creatu#es as t#ese could #e destroyed. #etween us and Lea#herhead, however, la# the third #ylinder, with its guardi#g giants. Had I been alone, I think I should #ave taken my chance and st#uck across country. B#t th# artilleryman dissuaded me: "It's #o kindness to th# right s#rt of wife," #e s#id, "to make #er a wido#"; an# in the end I a#reed to go w#th him, under cover of th# woods, northward as far as Stre#t Cobh#m before I parte# with him. Th#nce # #ould ma#e a big detour by Eps#m to rea#h Leatherhead. I s#ould h#ve started a# onc#, but my companion had been in active serv#ce and he knew better t#an that. He made #e ransack #he house #or # flask, which he filled with whiskey; #nd we lined every available pocket wit# packets o# biscuits and sli#es of mea#. T#en we crept out of the house, and ran as quickly as we cou#d down the ill-made road b# which I had come overnight. The houses seemed deserted. In the roa# lay a group of three charred bodi#s close together, struck dead by the Heat-Ray; and here an# there were things th#t pe#ple had dropped--a clock, a sl#pper, # silver spoon, and the like poor valuables. #t the corner turning up towards the pos# office a little cart, filled #ith boxes and furniture, and horseless, heeled over on a broken wheel. A cash b#x had been h#stily smashed ope# and thrown under the d#bris. #xcept the lodge at the #rphanage, which was still on fire, none of the houses had suffered #ery grea#ly h#re. T#e Heat-Ray #ad shaved the chimney tops and pa#sed. Yet, save our#elves, there did not seem to be a liv#ng soul on Maybury Hill. The major#ty #f th# inhabitants had escaped, I suppose, b# way of the Old Wokin# road--the road I had taken when # drove to Leatherhe#d--or #hey had hidden. We went down the lane, by the b#dy of th# man in #lack, sodden now from the overnig#t hail, and broke into the woo#s at the #oot of #he hill. We pushed through these toward# the railway without meeting a soul. The woods across the lin# were but the scarred and blackened ruins of woods; for the most pa#t the #rees had fallen, #ut a cert#in proportion still stood, dismal grey ste#s, with dark brown foliage instead of green. On our #ide #he fir# had done #o mo#e than scorch the nearer tre#s; it had failed t# secure i#s footing. In #ne place the woodmen had been a# wo#k on Saturday; trees, felled #nd freshly trimmed, lay in a clearing, wi#h he#ps #f sawdust b# the #awing-machine and its engine. Hard by was a temporary hut, deserted. There wa# not a breath of wind this morning, an# everything was strangely still. Even the birds wer# hushed, and #s we hurried along I and the artilleryman talk#d #n whispers and looke# now #nd again o#er our shoulders. Once o# twice we stopped to listen. After # time we drew near the road, and as w# di# so we heard t#e clatter o# hoofs #nd saw through th# tree stems three cavalry soldiers riding s#owly towards Woking. #e h#iled them, and they halted while we hurried towards them. I# was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of the 8th Hussars, #ith a stan# like # theodolite, which t#e arti#leryman told m# w#s a heliograph. "You are the first men I'#e see# coming this w#y this morning," said the lieutenant. "What's bre#ing?" H#s voice and face were eager. Th# #en beh#nd him stared cu#iously. The artilleryman jumped down #he bank into #he road and saluted. "#un destr#yed last #ight, sir. Have #een hiding. Trying to rejoin battery, si#. You'll come in #ight of the M#rtians, I expect, about half a mile #long this road." "What the dickens #re they like?" asked the lieut#nant. "Giants #n armour, sir. Hundred feet high. Three legs an# a body like '#uminium, with # mighty great head in # hood, sir." "Get out!" said the lieutena#t. "What confounded nonsense!" "You'll see, sir. They carry # kind of box, sir, that shoots fire and strikes you de#d." "What d'ye mean--a gun?" "No, sir," and the artilleryman began # vivid account of #he Heat-Ray. H#lfway through, the lie#tenant interrupted him and looked up #t me. # was still standing on t#e bank by the #ide of the road. "It's perfectly tru#," # s#id. "Well," #aid the lieuten#nt, "I suppos# it'# my business to see it #oo. Look here"--t# the artilleryman--"we're #etailed here clearin# p#ople ou# of thei# houses. You'd better go along and report yourself to Brigadier-#eneral Marvin, and tell him all you know. He's at Weybridge. Know the w#y?" "I do," # said; and #e turned h#s horse southward again. "Half a mil#, you s#y?" said he. "At most," I answered, #nd pointed over the treetops southw#rd. He thanked me and #ode on, a#d we saw them no more. Farther al#ng we came upon # group #f three women a#d two children in the road, b#sy clearing out a labourer's cottage. They ha# got h#ld of # little hand tr#ck, an# were pili#g it #p with unc#ean-looking bundl#s #nd shabby furnitur#. They were all too assiduously engaged to t#lk t# us as we passed. By Byflee# station we emerged fr#m t#e pin# trees, and f#und the country ca#m and peaceful under the morning sunlight. We were fa# be#ond the r#nge of the Heat-Ray there, and had it n#t b#en for the si#ent desertion o# some of the houses, t#e stirring movement of packing in others, a#d t#e knot #f soldiers sta#ding on the bridge over the railway and staring down the line towards Woking, th# day would have seemed very like any othe# S#nday. Several #arm #aggons and #arts were moving c#eakily #long the r#ad to Addlestone, and suddenly through the gate of # field we saw, ac#oss a stretch of flat #eadow, six twelve-pounders #tanding neatly at equal distances pointing towards Wo#ing. The gunners stood #y the guns waiting, and the ammunitio# waggons w#re #t a business-like distance. The me# stood almost as if under inspectio#. "That's #ood!" said I. "They wil# ge# one fair shot, at any r#te." The artilleryman hesitated #t #he gate. "I sh#ll go on," h# said. Farther on towards Weybrid#e, #ust over the #ridge, there were a number of men #n white fatigue jackets throwing up a lon# rampart, #nd mo#e guns behind. "I#'s bows and a#rows ag#inst the light#ing, anyhow," said the artilleryman. "They 'aven't seen #hat fire-beam yet." The office#s who were not actively enga#ed stood and stared o#er the treetop# southwestward, #nd #he m#n digging would stop #very now and a#ain to stare in the same direction. Byfl#et was in a tumult; people packing, and # score of hussars, some of them dismounted, som# on horseback, were hunting them about. Three or fo#r black government waggons, with crosses i# white circles, #nd an ol# omnibu#, among other vehicle#, were #eing loaded #n th# villag# street. There were #cores of people, most of them sufficiently sabbatical t# ha#e assumed their best clothes. The soldiers wer# hav#ng the greate#t difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their position. We saw o#e shrivelled ol# fellow with # huge b#x and # score or more of flo#er p#ts containing or#hids, angr#ly e#postulating with the corporal who would lea#e them behind. I stopped and gripped #is #rm. "Do #ou know what's over the#e?" # said, pointing a# the pine t#ps that #id the Martians. "Eh?" said he, turning. "I was explainin' these is val#yble." "Death!" # shoute#. "Death is comi#g! Death!" and leavin# him to dig#st that #f he could, I hurried on after the arti#lery-man. At the c#rner I looked #ack. The soldier #ad le#t him, an# h# was still standing by hi# box, with the pots of orchids on the lid #f it, and staring vag#ely ov#r the trees. #o one in Weybrid#e could tell us where the headquarters w#re established; the whol# place was in such confus#on as I had nev#r seen in #ny town befo#e. #arts, carr#ages everywhere, the most astonishing misc#llany of #onveyances and horseflesh. The respectable inhabitants #f the place, m#n in golf and boating costumes, wi#es prettily d#essed, were packing, r#ver-side loafers energetically helping, ch#ldren excited, #nd, fo# the most part, highly delighted a# this ast#nishing variation of their Su#day experiences. In th# midst of it a#l the worthy vicar w#s very pluckily holding #n earl# celebration, and his bell was jangling #ut above the excitement. # and the artilleryman, seated on t#e step of the drinking fountain, #ade # very passable meal upon what we had bro#ght with us. Pat#ols of soldiers--here #o long#r hussars, but grenadiers i# wh#te--were warning peop#e to m#ve now or to take refuge #n their cellars as soon as th# firing began. #e saw as #e crossed the railway bridge that a growing crowd of people ha# assembled in and about the railway station, and the swarming platform was pi#ed wi#h boxes and packa#es. The ordinary tra#fic h#d been stopped, I believe, in ord#r to allow of t#e passage of tro#ps and guns t# Chertsey, and I have heard since t#at a savage str#ggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at a later hour. We remain#d a# Weyb#idge until midday, #nd at that hour we found #urselves at the place near Shepperton Lock #here the Wey and Thames join. #art of the time we spent helping #wo old wom#n to pack # little cart. T#e Wey has a treble mouth, an# #t this point boats are to be #ired, and there w#s a ferry across th# river. On the Shepperton sid# was a# inn with a lawn, and beyo#d that the to#er o# Shepperto# Church--it has been repl#ced b# a sp#re--rose above #he trees. Here we found a# excited and noisy crowd of fugitives. As yet the flight had #ot grown to a p#nic, but the#e #ere al#eady far more people tha# all the boa#s going #o an# fr# could e#able to cross. People came panting along under heavy burden#; one husband and wife wer# even carrying a small outhouse door between them, with #ome of their household goods piled there#n. One man told us he meant t# try to get #way from Shepp#rton statio#. There #as # #ot of shouting, and one man was even jesting. #he idea peop#e seemed #o hav# here was tha# t#e Martians were sim#ly formidable human bei#gs, who might a#tack and sack the town, to b# #ertainly destroyed in the end. Every now and then pe#ple would glance nervously across th# Wey, at the meadows tow#rds Chertsey, but everyth#ng over there w#s still. Across t#e Thames, except jus# where t#e boats landed, e#erything was quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey sid#. T#e people #ho landed there from the boats #ent tramping off down the lane. The big ferryboat had just made a journey. Three or four soldiers stood on #he lawn of #he inn, staring and jesting a# the fugitives, wi#hout offering to help. Th# inn #as closed, as it was now within p#ohibited hours. "What's that?" cried a boatman, an# "Shut up, #ou fool!" said # man near me to a yelping dog. The# t#e sou#d came #gain, th#s time from the direction #f Chertsey, a m#ffled thud--the sound of a gun. The f#ghting was beginni#g. Almost immed#ately u#seen batter#es ac#oss the river to our right, unseen because of the trees, #ook u# the chorus, firing heavily one #fter #he other. # woman screamed. Everyone stood arrested by th# sudden stir of battle, near us and yet i#visible to us. Nothing wa# t# be seen save flat me#dows, cows feeding unconcernedly for th# most part, and silvery pollard #illows motionless in the wa#m sun#ight. "The sojers'#l stop 'em," said # wo#an besi#e me, doubtfully. A haziness rose over th# treetops. T#en suddenly we saw a rus# of smoke far away up the river, a puff of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground heaved under foot an# a hea#y explosion shook the ai#, smash#ng two or three windows i# t#e houses near, an# leaving us astonished. "#ere #hey are!" shouted a man i# a blue jersey. "Yonder! D'yer see them? Y#nder!" Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured Martians appe#red, far away #ver the little trees, across the fla# meadows that stretche# towards Chertsey, and str#ding h#rriedly tow#rds t#e river. Little cowled figures t#ey seemed at first, goin# with a rolling motion and as #ast #s flying bi#ds. Then, advancing obli#uely towards #s, came # fifth. T#eir armoured bodies glittered in the sun as t#ey swept swiftl# forward upon the guns, growi#g rapidly larger as #hey drew nearer. On# on the ex#reme left, th# remot#st that i#, flourished a huge case high in t#e air, #nd #he ghostly, terrible Heat-Ray I had alrea#y se#n on Fri#ay nigh# smote toward# Chertsey, and struck the town. #t sight #f these strange, swift, and t#rrible crea#ures #he cr#wd ne#r th# wate#'s edge #eemed to me to be for a moment horror-str#ck. There was no s#reaming or shouting, but a sile#ce. Then a ho#rse murmur and a movement o# feet--# splashin# fr#m the water. # man, too fri#htened to drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung round a#d sent me staggering with # b#ow from the corner of his burden. A woman thrust a# me with her hand and rush#d past me. # turned with the rush o# the people, bu# I wa# not too terrified fo# thought. The terrible Heat-Ra# w#s i# my mind. To get #nder water! T#at was it! "G#t un#er water!" # sho#ted, unheeded. # faced about again, and rush#d towards t#e approaching Martian, rushed righ# down the gravelly #each and h#adlong into the water. Others #id the same. A b#atload of people putting back cam# leaping ou# as I rushe# pas#. The stones un#er my feet were muddy and slippery, and the riv#r was s# low that I ran perhaps twenty f#et scarcely waist-dee#. Then, as the Martian towered overhead scarcely a co#ple of hundred yards #way, I flung mysel# forward under t#e surface. The splashes o# the #eople in the boat# leaping into the river so#nded like thunderclaps i# my ear#. People were landing hastily on bo#h sides of the river. But the Martian machin# took #o mo#e notice for the moment of the people r#nning this way and that than # m#n would of the confusion of ants in a nest against which #is foot #as kicked. When, half suffocated, I r#ised my #ead above water, the Martian's hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing acr#ss the river, #nd as #t #dvanced #t swung loo#e what must have been the generator o# th# Heat-Ray. In #nother mom#nt i# was on the bank, #nd in a str#de wading half#ay across. The knees o# its foremost legs bent at the farther bank, and i# another moment #t had raised itself to its full height again, c#ose to the village of Shepperton. Forthwith the six g#ns which, unknown to anyone on t#e right bank, ha# been hidden behin# the o#tskirts #f tha# village, fired simultaneously. The sudden near concu#sion, the last close up#n the first, made my h#art j#mp. The mo#ster was already raising the case generating the Heat-Ray #s the first shell burst six yards above the hood. # #ave # cry of astonishment. I saw and thought nothing of t#e other four Martian monsters; my at#ention wa# riveted up#n the nearer inci#ent. Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the body as the hood twisted round in time t# re#eive, but not in time to do#ge, the #ourth shell. T#e shell b#rst clean in the f#ce of the Thing. The hoo# bulged, flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattere# fragments of red fle#h and glittering #etal. "Hit!" shouted I, with so#ething between a scream an# # cheer. I hea#d answering shouts from the p#ople in the water about me. I could #ave leaped o#t of th# wa#er with that momentary exultation. The decapitated colossus reeled like a d#unken giant; but it #id not fall over. It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer heeding #ts steps an# wi#h the camera that fired the Heat-Ray now rigidl# up#eld, it reeled swiftly #pon Shepperton. The living intelligence, the Martian within the hood, was slain and splashed #o the four winds of h#aven, and #he Thing was now but a me#e intricate devic# #f met#l whir#ing to destruction. It drove alo#g in a straight line, inc#pable of guidance. It struck the tow#r of S#epperton Church, smashing it down #s the impact of a battering ram might have done, swerved aside, blunde#ed on and collapsed #ith tremend#us force #nto the rive# o#t of my s#ght. A violent explosion shook the #ir, and # sp#ut of water, steam, mud, a#d shattered metal sho# #ar u# into the sky. A# t#e camera of the Heat-Ray #it the water, th# latter had immediately fl#shed #nto steam. In another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore but almost scaldingly h#t, came sweeping r#und the be#d upstrea#. # saw people struggling sho#ewards, #nd heard their screaming and shouting faint#y #bove the seething and roar of the Martia#'s collapse. For a moment # heeded nothing #f the he#t, forgot the patent need of self-preservation. I splashed through the tumultuous wate#, pushing asi#e a man in black t# do so, unt#l I coul# see round the bend. Half a doz#n deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the confusion #f the #aves. Th# fal#en Martian cam# into sight #ownstream, lying across the #iver, an# for #he most part submerged. Thick clouds of steam wer# pouring of# the wreckage, and through the tumultuously whirling wisps # could s#e, intermittently and vaguely, the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a #plash and spray #f mud and froth into the air. The tentacles swayed and st#uck lik# living arms, and, s#ve for th# helpless purposelessness of these movements, it was as if s#me wounded thing were struggling for its li#e amid the waves. Enormous #uantities of # rudd#-brown flui# were spurting #p in no#sy jets out of the machine. My #ttention was diverted f#om this death flurry by a furious yelling, like that of the thing called # siren in our manufacturing towns. # man, knee-deep near the towing path, shouted inaud#bly to me and pointed. Looking ba#k, I saw the other Mar#ians advancing with gigantic st#ides down #he riverbank from th# direction of Chertsey. T#e Shepperton gun# spok# this time unavailin#ly. #t that # ducked #t once un#er water, and, #olding my breath until movement was an agon#, blundered painfu#ly ahead under the surface as long as I could. The water was in # tumult about me, and rapi#ly growing hotter. #hen for # moment # raised my head to t#ke breath and throw the hair and #ater from my eyes, the #team wa# rising in a whir#ing white fog that #t first hid the Martians altogether. The noise was deafening. Then I saw them dimly, coloss#l figures of grey, magnified by the mist. They had pa#sed #y me, and t#o were stooping over the frothing, tumultuo#s ruins o# th#ir comrade. The third and #ourth stoo# bes#de him in th# water, one perhaps two hundred yards #rom me, the other towards L#leham. The generators of the Heat-Rays waved h#gh, and the #issing beams #mote down this #ay a#d that. The air was f#ll #f sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of noises--the clangorous din of #he Martians, the cr#sh of falling houses, the thud of trees, fences, sheds #lashing into f#ame, and th# crackling an# roaring of fire. Dens# black smoke was leaping up to m#ngle with t#e steam from the rive#, and a# the Heat-Ray went t# and fr# over Weybridge #ts impact was marked by flashes of incandescent wh#te, that gave pl#ce a# once to a smok# dance of lurid f#ames. The nearer houses still stood intact, awaitin# their fate, shadowy, faint and pallid in th# steam, with the fire b#hind them going to and fro. For a moment perhaps I stood there, breast-hig# in the almost boiling water, dumbfounded at #y position, hopeless of escap#. Through the reek # could see the people who had been with me #n the river scrambling ou# of the water through th# reed#, like little frogs hurrying through grass fr#m the advance of a man, or running to and fr# in utter dismay o# the to#ing path. Then suddenly the white flashe# of the Heat-Ray came leaping towards me. The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch, and darted out flames; the trees cha#ged to fire with a roar. The Ray fli#kered #p and down the t#wing path, licking off the #eople who ran t#is w#y and that, and came down to th# water's edge not fifty yar#s from where I stood. It swept across the river to Shep#erton, and t#e water in its track rose in a boiling weal crested with steam. I turned shoreward. In another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-poin# #ad rushed upon me. I screamed aloud, a#d scalded, half blinde#, agonised, I staggered through the leaping, hissing water towards the shore. #ad my foot s#umbled, it would have been #he end. I fell h#lplessly, #n full sight of the Mart#ans, upon the broad, bare gravelly s#it that runs down to mark the angle #f the Wey a#d Thames. # expected nothing bu# death. # have a dim memory of the fo#t o# # Martian coming down wit#in # score of yards of #y head, driving straight into th# loose gravel, whirling it #his way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense, a#d then of the four carry#ng t#e debris of thei# comrade between them, now clear and then pre#ently faint through a veil of smoke, receding interminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast space o# river and meadow. And t#en, very slowly, I realised that by # miracle # had e#caped. CHAPTER THIRTEEN HO# I FELL IN WITH THE CU#ATE After getting thi# sud#en lesson in the power of terrestrial weapons, the Martia#s retre#ted t# #heir ori#inal position up#n Horsell Common; a#d i# th#ir haste, and encumbered wi#h the debris of their smashed companion, th#y n# doubt overlooked many such a s#ray and #egligible victim as myself. Had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwit#, there was nothing #t that time between t#em and London but batteries #f twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly have reached the capita# in advance of the tiding# of their #pproach; a# su#den, dreadful, and destructive t#eir advent would ha#e been a# the earthquake that de#troyed Lisbon a century ago. But they were i# n# hurry. Cylinder followed cylinder on its interplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought them reinforcement. And me#nwhile the #ilitary a#d naval authorities, now fully a#ive to th# tremendous #ower of their antagonists, #orked with furious energy. Every minute a #resh gun c#me into position until, be#ore twilight, every copse, every row of subu#ban villas on the hilly slopes about K#ngston and Richmond, maske# an expectant #lack muzzle. And through the charred and desola#ed area--perhaps twenty square miles altogether--that enci#cled th# Ma#tian encampment #n Ho#sell Common, through charred and ruined village# amo#g the #reen trees, through #he blackened a#d smoki#g arcades that #ad bee# but a #ay ago #ine spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with t#e heliographs that were pr#sently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach. But th# Martians now understood our command of artillery #nd #he dange# of human proximity, and no# # man ventured within # mile of either cy#inder, save at th# price #f his lif#. I# would seem #hat these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon in g#ing to and fro, transfer#ing everyt#ing from t#e second and third cylinders--the second in Addlestone #olf Links and the third a# Pyrford--to their #riginal pi# #n Horsell Common. Over th#t, a#ove the b#ackened heather and ruine# b#ildings that stretch#d far a#d wide, stood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned the#r vast fighting-machines #nd descended i#to the pit. They were hard at work t#ere far into the ni#ht, and the to#ering pillar of dense green smoke that r#se therefrom #ould be seen from the hills about Merrow, and even, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom D#wns. And wh#le the Martian# behind me were thus preparing f#r their n#xt sally, and #n front of me Humanity #athered for the ba#tle, # made my way with infinite pai#s a#d labour from th# fi#e and smoke o# #urning Weybridge towards London. I saw a# abandoned b#at, very small and remote, drifting down-stream; a#d throwing off the most of my sodden cloth#s, I went after it, gained it, and so escaped out #f th#t destruction. There were no oars in the boat, but I co#trived to paddle, a# w#ll as my parboiled hands would allow, down the river towards Halliford and Walton, going very te#iously and continually looking behind me, as you may well un#erstand. I followed t#e river, because I cons#dered that the water gave me my bes# chance #f esca#e s#ould these giants re#urn. The hot water from the Martian's overthrow drifted downstream with me, so th#t f#r th# best part of a #ile I could see little of either #ank. Once, however, I made out a string of black figures hurrying across the mead#ws fro# the direction of Weybridge. Halli#ord, #t seemed, #as deserted, and several of the houses facing the river were o# fir#. It was strange to see #he place quit# tra#quil, quite desolate under t#e ho# blue sky, with th# smoke and little threads of flame going straight u# into the heat of t#e afternoon. #ever before had I seen houses burning wit#out the accompaniment of #n obstructive c#owd. A little farther on the dry reeds up #he bank were smoking and glowing, #nd a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a la#e fi#ld of hay. For a long time I drifted, so painful #nd weary was I after the violence I had been thro#gh, and so intense #he heat upon the water. Then my fears got the better of me again, a#d # resumed my paddling. The sun scorched #y bare bac#. At last, a# the bridg# #t Walton w#s coming into sight round the bend, m# fever #nd f#intness overcam# my fears, and I landed on the Mi#dlesex bank and l#y down, deadly sick, amid the long grass. # suppose the time was then about four or five o'clock. # g#t #p presently, walked perhaps half a #ile wit#out meeting a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge. I seem to rememb#r t#lking, wanderingly, t# myself during that last spurt. I was als# very thirsty, and bitterly r#gretful I had drunk no more water. It is # cu#ious thing #hat # felt angry with #y wife; # canno# account for it, but my impotent desire to reach L#atherhead worried me excessively. I do not clearly remember the ar#ival of the cur#te, s# that probably # dozed. I became aw#re of #im as a #eated figure #n soot-smudged sh#rt sleeves, and wit# his upturned, clean-shaven f#ce staring at a faint flickering that danced ov#r the sky. The sky was what is called a mac#erel sky--rows and #ows of f#int down-plumes o# cl#ud, just tinted with the midsummer sunset. # sat up, a#d at the rustle of #y motion he looked at me quickly. "Ha#e you a#y wa#er?" I asked abruptly. He sho#k his head. "You have b#en aski#g for water f#r the last hour," he said. For a moment w# were silent, taking stock o# #ach other. I dare say he foun# me a strange enough figure, n#ked, save for my water-soaked trousers and socks, sca#ded, and my fa#e and shoulders blackened b# the smoke. Hi# face was # fair weakness, his chin retreat#d, and his hair lay in crisp, almost flaxen curls o# his low forehead; #is eyes we#e rather large, pale blue, #nd blankly staring. H# sp#ke abruptly, look#ng vacan#ly away from me. "What does i# mean?" #e said. "What do #hese things mean?" I stared at him and made no answer. #e extended a thin #hite hand and spo#e in almost a com#laining tone. "Why are these things permitt#d? What sin# have we done? The morning service was over, I was walking through the roads to clear my br#in f#r the afternoon, an# then--fire, earthquake, death! As if i# w#re Sodo# and Gomor#ah! All our work und#ne, all the work---- What are these Ma#tians?" "What are we?" # answered, clearing my throat. #e gripped his knees and turned to look a# #e again. F#r half # minute, perha#s, he stared silently. "I was w#lking through the road# to cle#r my bra#n," #e said. "And suddenly--fire, earthquak#, dea#h!" H# relapsed into silence, with his chin now sunken almost t# his knees. Presently he b#gan waving h#s hand. "All t#e work--all the Sunday schools--What have we done--#hat has Weybridge done? Everything gone--everything destroyed. The church! #e rebu#lt #t only three years ago. Gone! Swept out of existen#e! Why?" Another pause, and he broke out again li#e one demented. "The smoke of her burning goeth #p for ever and ever!" #e sh#uted. His eyes f#amed, an# #e pointed a lean fing#r in #he direction of Weybridge. By this time I was #eginning to take #is measure. The tremendous trage#y in which he had #een #nvolved--it was ev#dent #e was a fugitive from Weybridge--had driven #im #o the very #erge of his reason. "Are we far fr#m Sunbury?" I said, in # matter-of-fact tone. "What are w# to do?" #e asked. "A#e these creatures everywhere? Has the #arth been given over t# them?" "Are we far fro# #unbury?" "Only #his morning I officiated at early celebration----" "Things have changed," I said, quietl#. "You must ke#p your head. There #s still hope." "Hope!" "Yes. Plen#iful hope--for all this dest#uction!" I bega# to expla#n #y view of our position. He listened at first, but a# I w#nt on th# interest dawnin# in his eyes g#ve place to their forme# stare, and his regard wande#ed from m#. "This must be the beginning of the end," he said, #nterrupting me. "The end! The great and terri#le #ay of the Lor#! Whe# #en s#all call upon the mountains and the rocks to fall upo# the# and hide t#em--hide them from the face #f Hi# that sitteth upo# th# throne!" # began t# understand the position. I #eased #y laboured re#soning, struggl#d t# my feet, and, standing o#er hi#, laid #y hand on his shoulder. "Be a man!" said I. "You are scared #ut of #our wits! What good #s religion #f it collapses u#der calamity? Think of what earthquakes and flood#, wars an# volcanoes, ha#e done before to men! Did you thi#k #od h#d ex#mpted Weybridge? He is not a# insurance agent." For a tim# he sa# in blank silence. "But how can we escape?" he asked, sudden#y. "They a#e invulnerable, they are p#tiless." "Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other," I answer#d. "And the mightier they are th# more sane and war# should we be. One of #hem was killed yonder not three hours ago." "Killed!" h# said, stari#g about him. "How can God'# ministers b# killed?" "I sa# #t happen." I proc#eded to te#l him. "We have chanc#d to co#e in for the thick o# it," said I, "and that is all." "What is that flicker in #he #ky?" he as#ed abruptl#. I to#d him it w#s the heliograph signalling--that it was t#e sign of human help a#d effort i# the sky. "We a#e i# t#e mids# of it," I said, "q#iet as it i#. That #licker i# t#e sky t#lls o# the gathering storm. Y#nder, I t#ke it ar# the Martians, and Londonward, wh#re those hills rise #bout Richmond an# Kingston and the tree# give cover, earthworks are #eing thrown up and gu#s are being placed. Presently the Martians will be coming this way ag#in." And even #s I spo#e he sprang to hi# feet and stopped #e by a gesture. "Listen!" he said. From beyond the low hills acr#ss the water came the dull r#sonance of di#tant guns and # remote weird cry#ng. Then everything #as still. A coc#chafer #ame droning over t#e hedge an# past #s. Hig# in the west th# cres#ent moon hung #aint and pale above the smok# of #eybridge and Shepperton an# the hot, #till splendour of the suns#t. "#e had #etter follow this path," I sai#, "northward." CHAPT#R FOURTEEN #N LONDON My younger brother was in London when the Martians f#ll at Woking. He w#s # medical studen# #orking for a# #mminent examination, and he hear# nothing #f the arrival #ntil Saturday morning. The morning pa#ers on Satu#day contained, i# addition to lengthy s#ecial articles on th# planet Mars, on life #n the planets, and so forth, a b#ief and v#guely wor#ed telegram, all t#e more striking for its brevity. The Martians, ala#med b# the approach of # crowd, h#d killed a number #f people with # quick-firi#g gun, so #he story ran. The telegram concluded with th# word#: "Formidable as they se#m #o be, the Martians #ave not moved from the pit into which the# have fallen, and, indeed, seem in#apable o# doing so. Probably t#is is due #o the relative strength of the earth's gravitational energy." #n that last text their leader-writer expande# v#ry comfortingly. O# course all th# students in t#e crammer's biology cl#ss, to which m# br#ther #ent that da#, w#re in#ensely interested, but there were #o signs of any unusual excitement i# the streets. The afterno#n paper# puffed scraps of news under big head#ines. They had nothing to tell beyond the movements of troops about the common, #nd th# burning #f the pine woods betwe#n Woking and Weybridge, until eight. Then the St. Ja#es's Gazette, #n an extr#-special edition, announced #he bare fact of the interruption of telegraphic communication. This #as #hought to be due #o the falling of burning pine trees across the line. Nothing more of #he fighting was known that night, the night of my dr#ve to Leatherhe#d and #ack. My broth#r f#lt no anxiety about us, as he knew fr#m th# description #n the papers that #he cy#inder w#s a g#od two miles #rom my house. H# made up his mind to run dow# that night to #e, in or#er, as #e says, to se# the Things before they were killed. He dispa#ched a telegram, which never reached me, a#out four o'clo#k, and spent the evening at a music ha#l. In London, also, o# Saturday night #here was a thunderstorm, a#d my brothe# reached Waterloo in # cab. On the platform from which the midnight train usually starts #e learne#, #fter some waiting, that an accident prevented trains from reaching Woking that night. The nature of the acc#dent he could not asc#rtain; inde#d, the railway authorities did no# clearly know #t that time. There was ve#y little excitement #n the station, as the officials, failing to rea#ise that #nything further than # breakdown between Byfleet and Woking junctio# h#d occurred, were #unning the theatre trains which usually #assed t#rough W#king round by Virgin#a Water or G#ildford. They were busy making the necessary arran#ements #o alter the route of the Southampton and #ortsmouth #unday Le#gue excu#sions. A no#turnal ne#spaper reporter, mistaking my brother #or t#e traffic manager, t# whom he bea#s a slight res#mblance, waylai# an# tri#d to interview him. Few peopl#, excepting the railway offic#als, connected the breakdown with the Martians. I have read, in another account of these events, that on Sunday morning "all London was electr#fied #y th# #ews from Woki#g." As a #atter #f fact, there was nothing #o justify t#at very extravagant phrase. Plenty of Londoners did n#t hear of the Martians u#til t#e panic of Monday morning. Those who did took so#e ti#e #o realise all t#at the hastily worded telegrams in the Sunda# papers conve#ed. T#e majority of people in London do not read Sunday papers. #he habit #f personal security, moreov#r, is so deeply fixed i# the Londoner's mind, and startling intell#gence so much # matter of course in the papers, that #hey coul# read without any personal trem#rs: "About se#en o'clock l#st ni#ht the #artians came out of t#e cylinder, a#d, moving about under an armour o# metallic shiel#s, have completely wre#ked Woking st#tion with t#e adjacent houses, and massacred a# en#ire batt#lion of t#e Cardigan Regiment. No details a#e known. Ma#ims have been abs#lutely u#eless against their armour; t#e field g#ns have been disabled by them. #lying hussars have b#en galloping into Chertsey. #he Martians appear to be moving slowly towards Chertsey or Wi#dsor. Great anxiet# #revails in We#t Sur#ey, and earthworks are being thrown up to check t#e adv#nce Londonward." That w#s how t#e Sunday Sun #ut #t, and a c#ever and remarkably prompt "handbook" article in the Referee compare# the affai# t# # menagerie suddenly let loose in # villa#e. No on# in Londo# knew positively of th# nature of the armoured #artians, and there w#s still a #ixed idea that these monsters must be sluggish: "crawling," "creeping painf#lly"--such expressions oc#urred in almost all the earlier r#ports. None of the telegrams could have been written by an eyewi#ness of their advance. #he Sunday paper# printed separate editions #s furth#r news ca#e to hand, some even in def#ult of it. But there was practically nothing more to tell people until l#te in the afternoon, when the authorities ga#e t#e pr#ss agencies the news i# their possession. It was stated #hat the people of Walto# and Weybridge, and #ll the district were pouring al#ng the roads Londonward, #nd that was all. My brother w#nt #o chur#h at the Foundling Hospital i# th# morning, still in ignorance #f what had h#ppened o# the previous night. There h# heard allu#ions made t# the #nvasion, and a special prayer fo# p#ace. Coming out, he bought a Referee. He beca#e alarmed at the news in this, and went ag#in to Waterloo station to find out i# comm#nication were restored. The omnibuses, carriages, cyclists, and innumerable people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely affected by th# strange intelligence that t#e n#ws venders were disseminating. People we#e interested, #r, #f alarmed, alarmed only on #ccount of #he local residents. At #he s#ation he heard for the first time that th# Windsor and Chertsey lines were now interrupted. The porters told #im that several remarkable t#legrams had been rec#ived in the morning #rom Byf#eet and Chertsey stations, but #hat these had abruptly ceased. M# b#other could ge# very little precis# detail out of them. "There's fighting goin# on about #eybridge" was the extent of their information. The train service #as #ow #ery much disorganised. Quite a number of #eople who had been expecting friends f#om places on #he S#uth-Western network we#e standing about the st#tion. One grey-h#aded old gentleman came and #bused the South-Western Compan# bit#erly to my b#other. "I# wa#ts sho#ing up," he said. #ne or two t#ains came in from Richmond, Putney, and Kingston, containing peo#le #ho had gone out for a day's boating and found the loc#s closed #nd a feeling of panic in #he air. A m#n in a blue and wh#te blazer addressed my brother, full of stran#e tidings. "There's hosts #f people driving i#to Ki#gston in traps and carts a#d t#ings, with boxes of valuables and a#l that," he sai#. "The# #ome from Molesey and Weybridge and Walton, and they s#y there's been guns heard at Chertsey, heavy firing, an# that mounted soldiers have told them to get off at once because the Martians #re coming. We heard g#ns firing #t Hampton Cou#t station, but we thought i# #as thunder. Wha# the dickens does it a#l mean? Th# Mar#ians can't get out of their pit, can they?" M# #rother could not tel# him. Afterward# he found that the vague feeling o# alarm had spread to th# clients of the underground railway, and that the #unday excursionists began #o return fro# all over the South-Western "lung"--Barnes, Wimbledon, Richmond Park, Kew, and so forth--at unnaturally early hour#; b#t no# a soul had anything more #han vague hearsay to tell #f. #veryone #onnected with the terminus seemed ill-tempered. About five o'clock the gathering crowd #n the stat#on was immensely excited by th# opening #f the #ine of communication, which is almost invariably closed, between t#e South-Eas#ern a#d the South-Western stations, and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and carriages crammed with sol#iers. These were the guns tha# were brought up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston. Ther# was #n exchange of pleasantries: "You'll get #aten!" "We're the beast-tamers!" and so forth. # little while af#er that # squad of police came in#o the station and b#gan to clear the public o#f #he platforms, and my brother went out into the street again. T#e c#urch bel#s were ringing for ev#nsong, and a squad of Salvation Ar#y lassies came singing down Waterloo Road. O# th# bridge a number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came drifting do#n the stream in patches. The sun was just setting, and the Clock Tower an# t#e Houses of Parliam#nt rose against one o# the most peaceful skies it is possible to imagi#e, a sky of gol#, barred with long transverse stripes of reddish-purple cloud. There was talk of a floating body. One of the men there, # reservist #e said he was, told #y brother h# had seen the heliograph flickering in the west. In Wellington Stree# my bro#her met a couple of sturdy roughs who #ad just been rushed out of Fleet St#eet with still-#et newspapers #nd staring placards. "Dreadful catastrophe!" the# bawl#d one #o the other do#n Wellington Street. "Fighting #t Weybridge! Full description! Re#ulse of the Marti#ns! Lon#on in Danger!" He #ad to give threepence for a cop# of that pa#er. T#en i# #as, and then only, that he re#lised something of the full power and terror of these monsters. He learned that the# were not m#rely a ha#dful of small slugg#sh creatures, but that they were minds swaying vas# mechanical bodies; a#d that they could move swiftly a#d smite with suc# power that e#en the might#est guns could not stand against them. They were described a# "vast spiderlike machines, nearly a hundred feet high, capable o# the speed of a# express train, and able to #hoot out a be#m of intense heat." Masked batteries, chiefly of field g#ns, ha# b#en planted in the country about Horsell C#mmon, and especially between th# #oking distric# and London. Fi#e of #he machines had #een seen mo#ing towards the Thames, and one, by a #appy #hance, had been destroyed. In the other cases the s#ells had mi#sed, and the batt#ries had been at once annihilated #y the Heat-Rays. Heavy los#es #f #oldiers were mentioned, but the tone o# the dispa#ch w#s optimistic. Th# Martians had been re#ulsed; they were not invulnerable. Th#y had re#reated to th#ir triangle of cylinders again, in the circle about Woking. Signallers with heliographs we#e pushing forward upon t#em from all sides. G#ns we#e in rapi# transi# from Windsor, Portsmouth, Aldershot, Woolwich--even from #he north; among othe#s, lon# wire-guns of ninety-five t#ns #rom Woolw#ch. Altogether one hundred and sixteen were in position or being hastily placed, chiefly coverin# London. Never before in England h#d there been su#h a vast or #apid concentration o# military material. Any further cylinder# that fell, i# was hoped, cou#d be destroyed at once by hig# explosives, which were being rapidly manufac#ured and distributed. No doubt, ran the report, the situation was of the strangest and g#avest description, but the pub#ic was exh#rted to #void and discourage panic. No doubt the Martians were strang# #nd terrible in the extreme, but a# t#e outsi#e th#re co#ld not be more than twenty o# th#m against our millions. The authorit#es had #eason to suppose, from the size o# #he cylinders, th#t at the outside there could not be more tha# five in each cylinder--fifteen altogether. And on# at least w#s disposed of--perhaps more. The public woul# be fairly warned of #he approach of danger, and elaborate measures were being t#ken for the pro#ection o# the peo#le i# the threatened southwestern suburbs. And so, with reiterated assurances #f the safety o# L#ndon a#d the ability of the authorities t# c#pe with the difficulty, this quasi-proclamation closed. This was printed in eno#mous type on paper #o fresh th#t it #as still we#, and there had been n# t#me to add a word of comm#nt. #t was curious, my brothe# said, t# s#e how ruthlessly t#e usual contents #f the paper had been ha#ked and taken out to give t#is #lace. A#l down Wellington Street p#ople could be seen fluttering out the pink sheets an# reading, and the Strand wa# sud#enly noisy with the voices of an army of hawkers following these pioneers. Men came scrambling off buses to secure copies. Certainly this n#ws excited pe#ple intensely, w#atever their previo#s apathy. T#e shutters of a map shop in the Strand #ere bein# #aken down, my brother said, and a man in his S#nday raiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, #as visible inside the window ha#tily fastening maps of S#rrey to the glass. Going on alon# the Strand t# Trafalgar Squar#, the paper in his hand, m# brother saw some of t#e fugitiv#s from West Surrey. The#e was a man with hi# w#fe and t#o boys and some article# o# furniture i# a cart such a# greengrocers use. He was driving from the direction of Westminster Bridge; an# close behind him #ame # hay waggon with #ive or six respectable-loo#ing people in it, #nd some boxes and #undles. The faces of these people were haggard, and their entire appearance contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the people on the omnibuses. People in fashionable clothing peeped at them out of cabs. They stopped #t the Square as if undeci#ed which w#y t# take, and finally #urned ea#tward along the Strand. Som# way behind these came a man in workda# clo#hes, riding o#e of those old-fashioned tricycles with # small front wheel. He wa# dirty and white in the face. My br#ther turned down #owards Victoria, an# met a number of such peop#e. #e had a vague idea that he mig#t see something of me. He noticed #n unusual number o# police regulating the traffic. Some of #he refugees were exchanging #ews with the people #n the omnibuses. One was professing t# have seen the Martians. "Boilers on stilts, I t#ll y#u, st#iding a#ong lik# men." M#st of them were exci#ed and animated #y #heir strange exper#ence. Beyond Victoria the public-house# were #oing a lively tr#de with #hese arriv#ls. At #ll t#e #treet corners g#oups of people were reading papers, #alking excitedly, or staring at the#e u#usual Sun#ay visitors. They s#emed to i#crease as night drew on, until at last the roads, my brother said, were like Epsom High Street on # De#by Day. My #rother address#d several #f these #ugitives and got unsatisfactory answers from most. None of #hem could tell h#m an# news of Wokin# except one #an, who assured hi# th#t Woking had bee# entirely destroyed on the previ#us nig#t. "I come from By#leet," he said; "man #n a bicycle came through the place in #he #arly morning, and ran from door to door warning us to come away. Th#n came soldiers. We went out to loo#, and there were clouds of s#oke to t#e south--nothing bu# smoke, and not a soul coming that way. Then we heard the gu#s at Ch#rtsey, and folks comin# from W#ybridge. So I've locke# up #y house and come #n." #t the time there wa# a strong feeling in the stree#s that the authorities were to blame f#r their incapacity to dispose o# the invaders without all this inco#venience. Abo#t eight o'clock a no#se of heavy firing was dist#nctly audible all over the south of London. My broth#r #ould not he#r it for the traffic in th# main thoroughfares, but by striking thr#ugh the quiet back streets to the river he w#s able to distinguish it quite p#ainly. #e walked fr#m Westmin#ter to h#s apartments near Regent's Park, about two. He was now very anxious on my account, and dis#urbed at the evident magnitude of th# trouble. His #ind #as inclined to run, even as mine had #un #n Saturday, on milit#ry details. #e thought of all those silent, expectant g#ns, #f the su#denly no#adic countryside; he tried to imagine "boilers on stilts" a hundre# feet high. There w#re one or two cartloads of refugee# passing along Oxford S#reet, and sev#ral i# the Marylebone Road, but so slowl# was the news spreading that Regent Street and #ortland Pla#e were full of their usual Sunday-night promenaders, albe#t they talked in groups, and along the edge of Regent's Pa#k t#ere were as ma#y silent couples "walking out" together unde# the scattered gas lamps as ever there had been. The nig#t was warm and stil#, a#d a li#tle oppressive; t#e sound of guns c#ntinued intermittently, and after midnight there s#emed t# be sheet lightning in t#e south. He read and re-read th# paper, fearing the worst had happened t# me. H# was restless, #nd after sup#er prowled o#t again aimlessly. He returned and tried in vain to divert his attention #o his examination no#es. He w#nt to bed a little after midnight, and was awa#ened #rom #urid dr#ams i# the small hou#s of Monday #y the sound o# door knockers, fee# running in the stree#, distant drumming, and a cl#mour #f bells. Red reflections danced on the ceiling. For a moment he lay astonished, w#ndering whether d#y had come or th# #orld gone mad. Then h# jumped out o# bed and ran #o the window. Hi# room #as an attic and #s he thrust his head out, up and down the street there were a dozen echoes to #he noise o# hi# window sas#, and heads in every kind of night disarray appear#d. Enquiries were being shouted. "They are coming!" bawled a policeman, hammering at #he door; "the Martians are coming!" and hurrie# t# the next door. #he sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the Albany Street Barracks, and every church #ithin earshot was hard at work #illing sleep w#th # vehement disorderly tocsin. There was a noise of doors #pening, #nd window #fter window in the houses opposite flashed from darkness into yellow illumination. Up th# street #ame galloping # closed carriage, bursting abruptly into noise at the corner, rising to a clattering climax under the window, and dying away slowly in th# distance. Clos# #n the rear of #his came a c#uple #f cabs, the forerunners of a long procession of fl#ing vehicle#, going for the mo#t part to Chalk Farm station, where the North-Western #pecial t#ains were loading up, instead o# coming d#wn t#e gradient into Euston. For a long #ime my brother stared #ut of t#e window #n blank astonishment, watching the policemen hammering at door after door, an# delivering their incomprehensible m#ssage. The# the do#r behind him opened, #nd th# #an wh# lodged ac#oss #he landing came in, dressed only in shirt, trousers, and slippers, his braces loose about his waist, hi# h#ir disord#red from his pillow. "W#at the devil is it?" he asked. "A fire? W#at a d#vil o# a row!" They #oth crane# their h#ads out of the window, straining to hear what the po#icemen were shouti#g. People #ere coming out of the #ide streets, and standing #n groups at the corners talking. "What the devil is i# all about?" said my brother's fellow lodger. My brother answered him vaguely and began to dress, running with each garment to the wind#w in order to #iss no#hing #f the #rowing excitement. A#d presently men selling unnaturally #arly newspapers came bawling into th# str#et: "London i# danger #f suffocation! The Kingston an# Richmond #efences forced! Fearful massacres i# the Thames #alley!" A#d all about him--in the rooms below, in the houses on each side and acros# the roa#, and behind in t#e Park Terraces #nd in the hundre# other stree#s of that part of Marylebone, #nd t#e Westbourne Park district and St. P#ncras, and westward and nor#hward in Kilburn and St. John's Wood a#d Hampste#d, and eastward in Shoreditch and Highbury a#d Haggerston an# Hoxton, and, indeed, through all th# vastness of London from Ealing t# East Ham--people were rubbing their eyes, and #pening wi#dows to stare out and ask aimle#s questions, dressing hastily as the first breath o# the coming storm of Fear bl#w through the streets. I# was the dawn of #he great panic. London, which h#d gone to bed on Sunday night oblivious an# inert, was awak#ned, in the small #ours of #onday morning, to a vivid sense o# danger. Unable from #is window to learn what wa# happening, my brother went #own a#d out into the street, just as the sky between t#e par#pets of the houses grew pi#k with the early dawn. The #lying peo#le o# f#ot and #n vehicles gre# mo#e numerous ev#ry moment. "Bl#ck Smoke!" he hea#d people crying, and aga#n "Black S#oke!" The contagio# of such # unanimous fear #as inevitable. A# my brother hesitate# #n t#e #oor-step, #e saw another news vende# approaching, a#d got a paper forthwith. The man was running away with the rest, and sel#ing his papers for a shilling e#ch as he ra#--a grotesque mingling of profit and panic. And f#om this paper my brother read tha# catastrophic dispa#ch of the Commander-in-Chief: "The Martians are able to disch#rge enormous clouds of a #lack and poisonous vapour by means of rockets. They have smothered o#r batteries, destroyed Richmond, Kingston, and #imbledon, a#d are advancing #lowly to#ards Londo#, destroying everything o# the way. #t is #mpossible t# sto# them. T#ere #s no safety from the B#ack Smoke but in instant flight." T#at was all, bu# it was en#ugh. The whole population of th# great six-million city was stirring, slipping, runnin#; presently it would be pouring en masse northward. "Black Smoke!" the v#ices cried. "Fire!" The #ells of the neighbouring chur#h made a jan#ling tumult, a cart carelessly driven smashed, amid shrieks an# curses, against t#e wate# trough u# #he str#et. Sickly yello# lights went to an# fro #n th# houses, and s#me o# the passing cabs flaunted unextingu#shed lamps. And overhead #he dawn was gr#wing brighter, clear and steady and calm. He heard footsteps #unning to #nd fro i# #he roo#s, and #p and down sta#rs behind him. His landlady c#me t# the door, loosely w#apped i# dressing go#n and shawl; her #usband follo#ed ejaculating. As #y broth#r began t# realise t#e impo#t o# all these things, #e turned hastily to #is own #oom, p#t a#l his availabl# money--some ten pounds altogether--into h#s pockets, an# wen# out again into th# streets. CHAPTER FIFTE#N WHAT #AD HAPPENED IN SURREY It was while #he curate had #at and talked so wildly to me #nder the hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my #rother was watching the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that the Martians had resumed the offensive. So far as one can ascert#in from th# conf#icting accounts that have been put forth, t#e majority of them remained bu#ied with preparations #n the Horsell pit until nine t#at night, hurry#ng #n some operation that disengaged hug# volumes of gre#n smoke. But three certainly came out abou# eight o'cloc# and, advanc#ng slowly and cautiously, made th#ir way through Byfleet a#d Pyrford toward# Ripley #nd Weybridge, an# #o came in sight #f th# expectant #atteries against the setti#g sun. These Martians d#d #ot advance in a body, #ut in a line, each perhaps a mile and # half from #is nearest f#llow. They communicated wi#h one another by m#ans of sirenlike howls, running up and do#n the scale from one note to anoth#r. I# was this howling and f#ring of the gu#s at Ripley and St. George's H#ll tha# we had heard at Upper Halli#ord. The Ripley gunners, un#easoned artillery volunteers #ho ought never #o hav# been placed in such a position, fired #ne wild, premature, ineffectual volley, and bol#ed on hor#e a#d foot t#rough the deserte# village, while the Martian, without using his Heat-Ra#, wal#ed serenely over their guns, stepped gingerly among them, passed in front of them, and so c#me unexpected#y upon the guns i# Painshill Park, which he destroyed. T#e St. George's Hill men, however, were b#tter led or #f a better mettle. Hidd#n by # pine wood a# they were, they seem to h#ve been quite unsuspected b# the Martian nearest to them. Th#y laid their g#ns as deliberately #s if t#ey had been #n parade, and fir#d at about a thousand yards' range. The shells flashed al# #ound him, and he was seen to a#vance # few paces, stag#er, and go down. Everybody yelled together, and the guns were reloaded in frantic haste. The overt#rown Martian set u# a prolonged ulula#ion, an# immediately a second glittering g#ant, an#wering him, appeared over th# trees to the #outh. It w#uld s#em that # leg #f the tripod had b#en #mashed by on# #f #he shells. T#e whole #f th# second volley flew wide of the Martian on t#e g#ound, and, simultaneously, both his companions brought their Heat-Rays #o b#ar on the battery. The ammunition blew up, the pine tree# all about t#e guns flashed int# fire, a#d only one or two of the men who were already ru#ning over the crest of the hill escaped. After this it would #eem that t#e #hree took counsel together a#d halted, and the scouts who were watchin# them report that th#y remained absolutely s#ationary fo# t#e next half hou#. Th# Martian who #ad been overthrown crawled tediously o#t o# his hoo#, a small brown figure, oddly sugges#ive from that distance of a #peck of bli#ht, and apparen#ly engaged in #he repair #f h#s support. About nine he #ad finished, for his c#wl was th#n seen above the trees again. It w#s a few minutes pas# nine that nig#t when #hese three se#tinels were joined b# four other Martia#s, eac# carrying a thi#k black tube. A similar tube was handed to each o# the three, and t#e se#en proce#ded to distribute themselves at equal #istances alo#g a curved line between St. George's Hill, Weybridge, an# th# village o# Send, southwest of Ripley. A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills befo#e them so soon #s the# began to mo#e, and warned the waiting batteries about #itton and Esher. A# #he same time four #f their fighting machines, similarly armed with tubes, crossed the #iver, and two of them, black against #he #estern sky, came i#to sight of myself an# the curate a# we hurr#ed wearil# and painfully along the road that runs northw#rd out of Halliford. They moved, a# it seemed to us, #pon # cloud, for a milky mist covered the fields and rose #o a third of th#ir height. At t#is #ight #he curate cried faintly in his throat, and began runni#g; but I knew it was n# good running #rom a Martian, a#d I turned aside and c#awled through dewy nettles and brambles int# the broad ditch by the side of th# road. He l#oked back, saw what # was doing, and t#rned to join me. The two halted, the near#r t# us standing #nd facing Sunbury, #he remoter #eing a gr#y indistinctness towar#s the eveni#g star, away tow#rds S#aines. The occasional howling #f #he Martians h#d ceased; they took u# the#r positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absol#te silence. #t was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns. Never since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of # battle so still. To us and to an observer #bout Ripley i# would have had precisely the same effect--the Martians se#med in sol#tary possession o# the darkling night, #it only as it was #y the s#ender moon, the stars, the afterglow of #he daylight, and the ruddy glare from #t. George's Hill and the woods o# Painshill. But facing that cresce#t everywhere--at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton, Es#er, Ockh#m, behind hills and woods sou#h of th# river, and across th# flat grass meadows #o the north of it, #herever a cluster of trees or village houses gave sufficient cover--the #uns were wai#ing. The signal rockets burst and rained th#ir sparks through the night a#d vanishe#, and the spirit of all t#ose watching batteries rose #o # te#se expectation. The Martians had but t# a#vance i#to the line of fire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns glittering s# darkly in the early night, would explode into a thunderous fury of battle. No d#ubt #he thought that was uppermost i# # thousan# of those vigilant minds, even as it was uppermost in mine, w#s the riddle--how much they understood #f us. #id th#y grasp t#at w# in our millions were organized, disciplined, working t#gether? #r #id they #nterpret ou# spurts o# fire, the sudden stinging of ou# shells, our steady inves#ment #f th#ir encampment, as we s#ould the furious u#animity of onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees? D#d they dream the# #ight exterminate us? At that time no one knew what food th#y needed. A #undred such questions strug#led together in my mind #s I watched that va#t se#tinel shape. And #n the back of my mind was the sense of a#l the huge u#known and hidden forces Londonward. Had the# prepared pitfalls? Were the powd#r mills at Hounslow ready #s a snare? #ould the Londoners #ave the heart and courage t# ma#e a greater Moscow of #heir mighty province of houses? #hen, afte# an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching #nd #eering through t#e hedge, cam# a sound like th# dist#nt concussion of # gun. #nother nearer, an# then #nother. An# then the Martian be#ide us r#ised h#s tub# o# high and discharged it, gunwise, w#th a heavy report that made #he groun# h#ave. The one towar#s Staines answered him. There was no flash, no smoke, simply #hat #oaded detonation. I was so excited by these heavy minut#-guns following one another that I s# #ar forgot my personal s#fety and my #calded hands as to clamber up int# #he hedge and stare towards Sunbury. As I di# so a second re#ort followed, a#d # big projectile hur#led overhead towards #ounslow. I expected at #east t# #ee smoke o# fire, or so#e such evidence of #ts work. But all I saw was the deep bl#e sky above, with one s#litary star, and the #hite mis# spreading wide #nd low beneat#. And there #ad been no crash, no answe#ing e#plosion. The silence was restored; #he minute lengthened to three. "What #as happened?" said the curate, standing up beside me. "Heaven knows!" sai# I. # bat flickered by an# vanished. A distant tumult o# shout#ng began and ceased. I looke# again at the Martian, an# saw #e was now moving eastward along #he riverbank, with # swift, rolling motion. Ever# moment I expected the fire of #ome hidden battery to spring upon #im; but #he evening calm was unbroken. The figure #f #he Martian gre# smaller as #e receded, and pr#sently the mist and the gathering night had swallowed him up. B# a com#on im#ulse we c#ambered higher. Towards Sunbury w#s a dark appearance, as though a conical hill h#d #uddenly #ome into being there, hiding our #iew o# the farther co#ntry; and then, remot#r across the river, over Walton, we saw another such s#mmit. These hill-like forms grew lower and broade# even #s #e #tared. Mo#ed by a sudden though#, I looked no#thward, and there # perc#ived a third o# the#e cloudy bl#ck kopjes h#d risen. Everything had suddenly become very still. Fa# away to the southeast, marking the #uiet, w# heard t#e Martians hoo#ing to one another, and then t#e air quivered again with the distant thud of t#eir guns. But the earthly arti#lery made no reply. Now at #he time #e could not understand these thin#s, but #ater I was t# learn the meaning #f #hese ominous kopjes that gathered in the twilight. Each of the Martians, standing in the great crescent I have described, had discharged, by means of the gunlike tube he carried, a huge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster #f houses, or other possibl# cover for guns, chanced to be in front o# him. Som# fired only one #f these, some two--as in the case of #he #ne we had seen; th# one #t Ripley i# said to have discharg#d no fe#er than five at that time. Thes# can#sters smashed #n striking the ground--they did not explode--and inc#ntinently disengaged #n enormous #olume of heavy, inky #apour, coiling and pouring upwa#d in a huge and ebony #umulus cloud, a gaseous hill that sank and spread its#lf slowly ov#r the surrounding country. And the tou#h o# #hat vapour, the inhaling of its pungent wisps, was death to all #hat breathes. It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that, after the #irst tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank down t#rough the a#r and poured over #he ground in a #anner #ather liquid t#an ga#eous, abandoning #he hills, and streaming into the #alleys and #itches and watercourses e#en #s I have heard the c#rbonic-acid gas that pours from vo#canic clefts i# wont t# #o. And where it came upo# water som# chemical action occurred, and the surface would be instantly covered with a powd#ry scu# tha# sank slowl# and made way for more. The #cum was absolutely insoluble, and it is # strange thin#, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that #ne could drink withou# h#rt the water f#om whi#h it h#d been straine#. The vapour did #ot diffuse a# a true gas would do. #t hung together #n ba#ks, flowing sluggishly dow# the slope o# t#e land and driving reluctant#y before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist and moisture of t#e ai#, and sank to the earth in the form #f dust. Save that a# unknown element gi#ing a group of #our lines in the blue #f the spectrum is concerned, we a#e st#ll entirely ignorant #f the nature of this substance. O#ce the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black sm#ke clung so closely to the groun#, eve# before #ts precipitation, that f#fty fe#t up #n the a#r, on the roof# and upper s#ories of high houses and on #reat trees, there was a chance of escaping its po#son altogether, as was prove# #ven that nig#t at Street Cobham and Ditton. The man who escaped at th# for#er place tells a wonderful story of the str#ngeness of its coil#ng flow, and how he looked down from the church sp#re and sa# the houses of the village rising #ike ghosts out of i#s inky nothingness. For a da# and a half he rem#ined #here, weary, starving and sun-scorched, the earth un#er the blue sk# an# against the pr#spect of the distant hills # v#lvet-black exp#nse, wi#h red roofs, green trees, a#d, later, black-veiled s#rubs a#d gates, barns, outhouses, and wall#, rising h#re and t#ere int# the sunlight. B#t tha# #as at Street Cobham, wh#re the blac# vapour #as allowed to rem#in un#il it sank of its ow# a#cord into the ground. As # rule the Mart#ans, wh#n it had served its purpose, cleared the air of it again #y wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it. This they did with the vapour bank# nea# u#, #s we #aw in the #tarlight from the w#ndow of a deserted house at Upper Halliford, wh#ther we had returned. Fro# there we could see the searchlights on Richmond Hill a#d Kingston Hill going t# and fro, and about eleven the windo#s rattled, and w# heard the so#nd of the huge sie#e guns that had been put in position there. These continued int#rmittently for the spa#e of a qua#ter of an hour, sending chance shots at #he invisible Martians at Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of the electric light vanished, and were replaced by a brigh# red glow. Then the fourth cylinder fe#l--a brilliant green meteor--as I #earned afterwards, i# Bushey Park. #efore the guns on #he Richmond and King#ton line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade f#r aw#y in the southwest, du#, I believe, to guns being fired haphazard before the black vapour could overwhelm the gunners. #o, setti#g about it as #ethodically #s men might sm#ke out a wasps' nest, the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the Londonward co#ntry. The hor#s of the crescent slow#y mo#ed apart, until at last th#y formed a line fr#m Hanwell to Coombe and Malden. All night through their destructive tu#es advanced. #ever once, after the Martian at #t. George's Hill was brought down, did they give the artillery t#e g#ost of a chance against them. Whe#ever there was a pos#ibility of guns being laid #or them #nseen, # f#esh canister of the black vapour was disc#arged, and w#ere the guns w#re openly displayed the Heat-Ray w#s brought to bea#. #y midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park an# the glare o# Kingst#n Hill thr#w their light upon a network o# black smoke, blotting out the whole valley of th# Thames an# extending as far a# the eye could reach. And through this two Martians slowly waded, and turn#d th#ir hissing steam jets this wa# a#d th#t. They were sparing o# the Heat-Ray that ni#ht, either because t#ey had but a limited supply of materi#l for i#s product#on or because they did not wish to d#stroy the country but on#y #o crush and ov#rawe the opposition th#y had aroused. #n the latter aim they certainly succeeded. Sunday n#ght was the end of the organised opposition t# their movements. After #hat n# body of men would stand against th#m, so hopeless was the enterprise. Even the crews of the torpedo-boats and destroy#rs that had brought their quick-firers up t#e Thames ref#sed to stop, mutinied, and went down again. The only offensive operation men ventur#d upon after that night was the preparation of mi#es and pitfall#, an# e#en in #hat their energies were fra#tic a#d spasmodic. O#e has #o imagine, as well as one may, the fate of those batteries towards Esher, waiting so tensely #n th# twilight. Survivors there wer# no#e. One may picture #he orderly expectation, the officers alert and watchful, the gunners re#dy, the ammunition piled to hand, the limber gunners with their horses a#d waggons, t#e gr#ups #f civilian spectators standing a# near as the# were permitted, t#e evening stillness, the ambulances and hos#ital tents with t#e burned a#d wounded from Weybridge; then the dull res#nance of th# shots the Martians fired, and the clumsy projectile whirling over the tree# and houses and smashing amid t#e neighbouring fields. One may picture, to#, the sudden shifting of th# attention, th# swiftly spreading coil# and bellyings of that blackness advancing headlong, towering heavenward, turning the twilight t# # palpable darkness, a strang# and horr#ble antagonist of vapour striding upon its victim#, men and horses near i# seen d#mly, running, shrieking, falling headlong, shouts o# dismay, the guns suddenly abandoned, #en choking and writhing #n #he ground, and the swift broadening-out of the opaque cone of s#oke. An# then #ight and extinction--nothing but a sile#t mass of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead. Before dawn the black vapour was pou#ing th#ough the streets of Richmond, and the disintegrating organism of government #as, with a last expiring effort, rousing the population of London to #he necessity of f#ight. CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE EXOD#S FROM LOND#N So #ou understand the ro#ring wa#e of fear that swept through the greatest city in the world just as Monday was dawning--the stream o# flight rising swiftly #o a torrent, lashing in # f#aming tumult round the railway stations, banked up into # horribl# struggle about the shipping in the Thames, and hurrying by every available channel northward and eastward. By ten #'clock t#e police organisation, and by midday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency, losing shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in t#at swift liquefaction o# the social body. All the railwa# lines nor#h of the Thames #nd the South-Eastern people #t Cannon #treet had been warned by midnight on Sunday, #nd trains were being filled. Pe#ple were fighting sav#gely #or standing-room in the carriages even #t tw# o'clock. By three, people were being trampled and crushed ev#n #n Bishopsgate Street, # couple of hundred #ards or m#re from Liverpool St#eet station; revolve#s were fired, peo#le stabb#d, and the policemen w#o ha# been sent t# direct the traffic, exhausted and infuriated, #ere breaking the heads of the people they were called out to protect. And as the day advanced and the engin# drivers and stokers refused to return to London, the pressure of the flight drove the people in an ever-thickening multitude a#ay fro# th# sta#ions an# along the northward-running roads. By midday a Martian had be#n see# at Barnes, #nd a clou# of slowly sinking black vapour #rove alon# #he Thames and ac#oss th# flats of Lambeth, cutti#g off all escape o#er the bridges i# its sluggish advance. Another bank drove ove# Ealing, and surrounded # little island of survivors o# Castle Hill, aliv#, but una#le #o escape. After a fruitless struggle to get aboard a North-Western train a# Chalk Farm--the engines #f t#e trains tha# had lo#ded in the goods yard there ploughed through shrieking people, and a dozen stalwart men fought to keep the crowd from c#ushing #he driver a#ainst his furnace--my brother emerged upo# the Chalk Farm road, dodged across throug# a h#rrying swa#m of v#hicles, and had the l#ck to be foremost in the sack o# a cycle s#op. The fro#t tire of the machin# h# got was punctured i# dragging it through the window, but #e got u# and off, notwithsta#ding, with no further injury tha# a cut wris#. T#e stee# foot #f Haverstock Hil# w#s impassable o#ing to severa# overturned horses, and my brother #truck into Belsize Road. So he got o#t of #he fury of the pa#ic, and, skirting the Edgware Ro#d, reached Edgware a#out seven, fasting and wearie#, bu# well a#ead of the crow#. Along the road p#ople were standing in t#e roa#way, curious, wondering. #e was passed #y a number of cyclists, some horsemen, and two motor cars. A mile from Edgware the r#m o# the wheel broke, an# the machine b#came unridable. He left it #y the roadside and #rudged through th# village. There were shop# half opened in #he main s#reet of the pl#ce, and people cro#ded on the pavement an# in the doorways an# windows, staring a#tonished at this extraordinary procession of fugitives that was beginning. He succeeded in getting some food at a# inn. For a time he remained #n Edg#are n#t knowing what n#xt to do. The flying p#ople increased in number. Many o# them, lik# my brother, seemed inclined to loiter i# the pla#e. There was no fresh news of the invaders #rom Mars. At that #ime t#e road was crowd#d, b#t as yet f#r from congested. #ost of the fugitives at that hour were mount#d on cycle#, but there were soon motor cars, hansom cabs, and carriages hurrying along, and the dust hung i# heavy clouds along the roa# to #t. A#bans. It was perhaps # vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford, where some friends of hi# lived, that a# #ast induced my brother to strike into # q#iet la#e running eastward. Presently he ca#e #pon a stile, and, crossing it, followed # footpath northeastward. H# passed near several farmhouses and som# little places whose nam#s he did n#t l#arn. He saw f#w fugitives until, in a grass #ane towards High Barnet, #e h#ppened upon two ladies who became his fellow #ravellers. He came upon them just #n time to #ave them. He heard their screams, and, hurry#ng round the corner, saw a coup#e #f men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in whi#h they had bee# driving, while a thir# with dif#iculty held the frightened pony's head. One of the ladies, a short woman dressed in white, w#s simply screaming; the other, a dark, s#ender figure, slashed at the ma# who gripped her a#m with a whip she held in her disengaged hand. M# brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and hurried towards the struggle. One of #he me# desisted and turned to#ards h#m, a#d my brother, realising from his antagonist's face t#at a fight was unavoidable, and being an expert boxer, went int# him forthwith and sent him down against t#e wheel of the chaise. It was no ti#e #or pugili#tic chivalry a#d my brot#er laid hi# quiet with a kick, and gripp#d the col#ar of the man who pul#ed at #he slende# lady's arm. He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung across his fa#e, a third antagonist struck him between the eyes, and the man #e held wrenched himself free and made o#f do#n the lane in the direction from which h# had co#e. Pa#tly stunned, he foun# himself faci#g the man who ha# he#d the horse's head, and #ecame aware #f the chaise receding from him down th# lane, swaying from side #o side, #nd with the wome# in it lo#king back. The man befo#e him, a bu#ly rough, tried t# close, and h# stopped him with a blow in the face. Th#n, realisin# that he w#s d#serted, he dodged roun# and made off down the lane after t#e chaise, wit# the sturdy man close behind him, a#d the fugitive, who had turned now, following remotely. Suddenl# #e stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong, and he #ose to his feet to fi#d himself with a #ouple #f antagonists again. H# would have had li#tle cha#ce against them had not t#e slender lady very pluckily pulle# up and returned to h#s help. It seems she had had a revolver all thi# time, but it had #een under the se#t when s#e and her compan#on were attacked. She fired at s#x yards' distance, nar#owly missing my brother. The less courageous of the robbers made off, and his c#mpanion followed him, cursing hi# cowardice. They both stopped i# sight dow# #he #ane, where the third man l#y i#sensible. "Take thi#!" said #he slender lady, #nd sh# ga#e my brothe# he# revolver. "Go back to the cha#se," said my b#other, wi#ing #he blood fro# his spl#t lip. She turned withou# a word--they were both panting--and they went bac# t# where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony. The robbers #ad evide#tly had enough o# it. When my #rother looked again t#ey were retreating. "I'll sit here," said m# brother, "if I may"; and he g#t upon the empty front seat. The l#dy lo#ked over her shoulder. "Give me the reins," she said, and laid the wh#p alo#g t#e pony's side. I# another mome#t a bend i# the #oad hid the three #en from my brother's eyes. So, quite unexpectedly, my brother found himself, panting, #ith # cut mouth, a bruise# jaw, and bloodstained knuckl#s, driving alo#g an unknown l#ne with t#ese t#o women. #e learned #hey were the wif# and the younger sister #f a surgeon living at Stanmore, who had come in th# sm#ll ho#rs from a da#gerous case at Pinner, and hea#d at some railway stat#on on his wa# of #he Marti#n #dvance. H# ha# hurried home, ro#sed the women--their servant had left them two days before--packed some provisions, put his revolver under the seat--luckily for my brother--and #old them to drive #n to Edgware, with the idea of ge#ting # train there. He s#opped behind to te#l the neighbou#s. He would overtake them, he said, at a#out half past #our in the morning, and now it was nearly nine and they had s#en nothing of him. They could not stop in Ed#ware becau#e of the growing traffi# through t#e place, and so they #ad come into this side lane. That was the story the# told my brother in fragments when presently they stopped again, neare# to New Barnet. #e promised to stay with #hem, at least until they could determine what t# #o, or until the missing man arrived, and professed to be a# expert shot with the revolver--a weapon strange to #im--in order #o give t#em confidence. They made a so#t of encampment by the wayside, a#d the pony bec#me h#ppy in the hedge. He told them of his own escape out of London, and all that he knew #f these Martians an# their ways. The s#n crept higher #n the sky, a#d after # time their talk di#d out and gav# place #o #n uneasy state of anticipat#on. Several wayfarers c#me along the lane, and of these my brother #athered such news #s he could. Every broken a#swer #e had deepened his impress#on o# the great disaster that had come on humanity, deepened his persuasion of the immediate necessity for prosecuting this flight. He urged the matter upon them. "We #ave money," #aid the slender woman, and hesitated. Her ey#s m#t my brother's, a#d #er hesitation en#ed. "So ha#e I," said my brother. She explained t#at they had as much #s thirty p#unds in gol#, besides a five-pound not#, and sugg#sted that with that they might g#t upon # train at St. Albans o# N#w Barnet. My br#ther thought that was hopeless, seei#g the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains, and #roached his own idea of striking across Essex towards Harwich and the#ce #scaping f#om the c#untry altogether. Mrs. Elphinstone--that w#s the name #f the woman in whit#--would listen to no reasoning, an# kept calling upon "George"; but her sister-in-law was #stonishingly quiet and deliberate, and at last #greed to my brother's suggestion. So, designing #o cross the Great North Road, they went o# towards B#rnet, m# brother leading th# pony to sa#e it as much as possible. As the sun crep# u# #he s#y #he day became exces#ively hot, and under foot a thick, whitish sand grew burning and #linding, so tha# they travelled only very slowly. The hedges we#e grey with dust. And as they adva#ced towards Barne# a tumultuous murmuring grew stronger. T#ey began to meet more people. F#r the most part these were staring before them, murmuring indistinct q#estions, jaded, h#ggard, unc#ean. One man in evening dress passed th#m on foot, his eye# #n the ground. They heard his voice, and, lo#king back #t hi#, #aw o#e hand clutched i# his ha#r and the o#her beating invisible things. Hi# paroxysm o# rage over, he #ent on his w#y without once looking back. As my brother's party went #n towards the crossroads to the south of Barnet they #aw a wom#n approaching th# road across some fields on t#eir left, carryin# a child and with two othe# #hildren; and then passed a ma# in dirty black, wi#h a #hick stick #n one hand and a s#all portmanteau in the oth#r. Then ro#nd the co#ner #f the lane, fro# between #he villas tha# guarded it at its confluence with the #igh road, #ame a litt#e c#rt drawn by a sweating black pony and driven by a sallow yout# i# a bowler hat, grey with dust. There were three girls, East End factory girls, #nd a #ouple #f little children crowded in the cart. "This'll tike u# rahn# Edgware?" asked t#e driver, wild-eyed, white-faced; and when my brother told h#m it would if h# turned t# the left, he #hipped up #t once without the formality of th#nks. My brother noticed # pale grey sm#ke or haze rising among #he houses #n front of them, a#d veiling the white facade #f # terrac# be#ond the road #hat appeared b#tween t#e backs of the villas. Mrs. Elphins#one suddenly cri#d out #t a number o# tongues of smok# red #lame leaping up above the houses in #ront of them aga#nst the hot, blue sky. T#e tumultuous noise resolved itself n#w i#to #he disorderly mingling of many voic#s, #he gride of many wheels, the creaking of wag#ons, a#d the staccato of hoofs. The lane came round sharply not fifty y#rds from #he crossroads. "Good heavens!" cried Mrs. Elphinstone. "What is this you are driving us into?" #y brother stopped. For the main road was a boiling stream of people, a t#rrent of human beings rushing northward, one pressing on another. # #reat b#nk of dust, white #nd luminous in the blaze of the sun, made ever#thing within twenty fe#t of #he ground g#ey and indistinct and was perpetua#ly ren#wed by the hurrying feet o# # dens# cro#d o# horses #nd of men and women on foot, and by th# wheels of #ehicles of every description. "Way!" my brother heard #oices crying. "Make way!" It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meet#ng poin# of the lan# and roa#; the crowd roared like a fire, and t#e dust was h#t and pungent. #nd, #ndeed, a little way up the ro#d a villa was burning and sendin# rolling m#sses of black s#oke across the ro#d to a#d to t#e confusion. Two men came pa#t them. Then a #irty wom#n, carrying # #eavy bun#le #nd weeping. A lost retriever dog, #ith hanging tongue, circled d#biously r#und th#m, scared and wret#hed, and f#ed at #y brother's threat. So much as they c#uld see #f the road Londonward betwe#n the hous#s to the right w#s # tumultuous stream #f dirty, hurrying peo#le, pen# in between the villas on either side; the black heads, the crowded f#rms, #rew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner, h#rried past, an# me#ged their individuality again in # receding mult#tude that w#s swallow#d up a# las# in a cloud o# dust. "Go on! Go on!" cried the voices. "#ay! Wa#!" One man's hands pressed on the back of #nother. My brother st#od a# the pony's head. #rresistibly attracted, he a#vanced slowly, pace by pace, down th# lane. Edgware had #een # scen# of confusion, Chalk Farm a riotous tumult, but this was # whole population in movement. It is hard to ima#ine that host. It had no character of its own. Th# figures pou#ed out past th# corner, and receded with their backs to the group #n the lane. Along th# margin c#me #hose #ho were o# foot thre#tened by th# wheels, stumbling in the ditches, bl#ndering into on# another. The c#rts and carriages crowded close upon one another, making little #ay for those swifter an# mor# impatient vehic#es that da#ted forward every now and then #hen an opportu#ity showed #tself of doing so, sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the villas. "Push on!" was t#e cry. "P#sh on! They are coming!" In one #art stood # blind ma# in the uniform of the Salvation Army, gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling, "Eternity! Eternity!" H#s voice was hoarse and very #oud so t#at my brother #ould hear him lon# after he was los# #o #ight #n #he dust. So#e #f the people who c#owded #n the ca#ts whipped stupidly a# thei# horses and quarrelled with o#her drivers; some sat motionl#ss, s#aring at nothing wi#h miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst, or lay prostrate in the b#ttoms of their conveyances. The horses' b#ts #ere covered with f#am, their eye# bloodshot. There were cabs, carriages, shop cars, waggons, beyond counting; a mai# #art, a road-cleaner's #art marked "Vestry of #t. Panc#as," a hug# timber wa#gon crowded with roughs. A brewe#'s dray ru#bled by with its #wo nea# wheels splashed #ith fresh blood. "Clear #he way!" c#ied the voices. "Clear the way!" "Eter-nity! Eter-nity!" came echoing do#n th# #oad. There w#re sad, haggar# #omen tra#ping by, well d#essed, with children t#at crie# #nd stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered in dust, their w#ary faces smeared with t#ars. W#th many of these c#me men, sometimes helpful, sometimes lowering and sa#age. Fighting side by side with them pushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags, wide-eyed, loud-voiced, #nd foul-mouthed. There wer# sturdy workmen t#rusting th#ir way along, wretched, unkempt m#n, #lothed lik# clerks or shopmen, struggling spasmodically; a wounded sol#ier my br#ther noti#ed, men dressed i# the clothes of railway porters, one wretched creature in a nightshirt with a c#at t#rown over it. But varied as its composition was, certain things all that hos# had in common. T#ere were fear and pain o# their fa#es, and fear behin# the#. A tumult up the road, a quarrel fo# a place in a wag#on, sent the whole host of them quickening their pac#; even # man s# scared and broken that #is knees bent under h#m was galvanised for # moment #nto renewed activity. T#e heat a#d dust had already bee# at #ork upon th#s multitude. Their skins were dry, their lips black and cracked. #hey were all thirsty, #eary, and footsore. #nd amid t#e various cries on# heard disputes, reproaches, groans o# weariness and fatigue; the vo#ces of mos# of them were hoarse and weak. Through it all ran a refra#n: "Way! #ay! The Martians are coming!" Few stopped #nd came aside from that flood. Th# lane opene# slantingly into the main road with a narr#w #pening, and had a delusive appearance of coming from the direction of London. Ye# # kind #f #ddy of people drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of the stream, who for the most par# rested #ut a moment before #lunging into i# #gain. # li#tle way #own th# lane, with two friends bending over him, lay a man w#th a bare leg, wrapped #bout wit# bloody rags. #e #as a lucky man t# have friends. A littl# old man, with a grey military moustache and a filthy black frock coat, limped out and sat down beside the trap, re#oved his boot--his sock was blood-stained--shook ou# a pe#ble, and hobbled on again; and then a litt#e g#rl #f eight or nine, all alone, threw her#elf under #he #edge close b# my brother, we#ping. "I can't go on! I can't go on!" M# brother woke #rom his to#por of astonishment and lifted her up, sp#aking gently t# her, #nd #arried her #o Mi#s Elphinston#. So soon #s my broth#r touched her sh# became quite still, as if frightened. "Elle#!" shrieked a woman in the #rowd, wit# te#rs i# h#r voice--"Ellen!" And t#e #hild suddenly darted away from m# brother, cry#ng "Mother!" "They are coming," said a man on horseback, ri#ing past alo#g the #ane. "Out o# the way, there!" bawled a coachman, towering high; and my brother saw a closed #arriage turning into the lane. The peop#e crushed back on one anoth#r to av#id the horse. My br#ther pushed the pony and chaise back into #he hedge, and the man drove #y and stopped at the turn of #he way. #t wa# # carriage, #ith a pole for # pair of horses, but only one was in the tr#ces. M# #rother saw dimly through the dust tha# #wo me# lifted out something on a white stretcher #nd pu# it gently on the grass beneath #he privet hedge. One o# t#e men came running to my brother. "W#ere #s t#ere any water?" he said. "He is dying fa#t, an# very thirsty. It #s Lord Garrick." "Lord Garrick!" said #y brother; "the C#ief Justice?" "The water?" #e said. "There may be a tap," said #y brother, "in so#e of the houses. W# have no water. I da#e not leave my people." #he man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the cor#er house. "Go on!" said the people, th#usting at him. "They are coming! Go on!" Then my brother's attention was distracted by # bearded, eagle-faced man lugging # small hand#ag, wh#ch split even as #y brother's eyes rested on it and disgorg#d # ma#s of sovereigns that seemed to break #p into separat# #oins as it struck the ground. They r#lled hither and thith#r among th# struggling feet o# men a#d horses. The m#n stopped an# looked #tupidly at the heap, and #he shaft of a c#b struck his shoulder an# sen# him reeli#g. He gave a sh#iek and dodged ba#k, and a cartwheel shaved him #arrowly. "Way!" cr#ed t#e men #ll about hi#. "Ma#e wa#!" So soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both hands op#n, up#n the #eap of coins, and began #hrusting handful# in hi# p#cket. A horse rose close upon h#m, and in another #oment, half rising, he had been borne down under the horse's hoofs. "Stop!" screamed my brother, a#d pushing a woman out of his way, tried to clutch the bit #f the h#rse. Before he could get to it, he heard a scream under the wheels, and saw through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch's back. The driver of the cart slashe# his wh#p at my brother, who ran round behind the cart. T#e multitudinous shouting confuse# his ears. Th# man was writhing in the dust among his scattered money, unable #o rise, f#r #he wheel had broken his back, and his lo#er limbs lay limp and #ead. #y brother stood up a#d yelled at the next driver, and a m#n on a black horse cam# to his assistance. "Get hi# out of the road," said he; and, clutching the man's collar with his free hand, m# brother l#gged him sideways. But #e st#ll clutch#d after his money, and regarded my brother fiercely, hamme#ing at h#s arm with # handful of gold. "Go on! G# on!" shouted #ngry voices beh#nd. "Way! #ay!" There was a sma#h as the pole #f a carria#e crashed into the car# that the man on horseback stopped. My brother looked #p, and the man with the gold twisted hi# head round a#d bit the wrist that held his collar. There was a c#ncussion, and the black horse came s#aggering sideways, an# the carthorse #ushed beside it. # hoof missed #y brother's fo#t by a hair's breadth. He rel#ased his grip on th# fallen man #nd ju#ped back. He saw anger change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on t#e ground, an# in a moment he w#s hidden and my brother #as borne backward and carried p#st the e#trance of #he lane, and had to figh# ha#d in the torrent t# recover #t. H# saw Miss Elphinstone covering h#r e#es, #nd a little child, with all a child's want #f sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated eyes at # dusty something that lay bla#k and still, ground and crushed under the rolling wheels. "Let u# g# back!" he shouted, #nd began turning the pon# round. "We cannot cross this--hell," h# said and they went back a hundred #ards the wa# th#y had come, until #he fighting crowd wa# hidden. As they passed the bend #n the lane my brother saw the face of the dying m#n i# the ditch und#r the privet, deadly white and drawn, and shining wi#h perspiration. The two women sat silent, crouching in their s#at and shivering. Then beyond the bend my brother sto#ped again. Miss Elphinstone was whi#e a#d pal#, an# her sister-in-law s#t w#eping, too wretched #ven to call upon "George." My brot#er was horrif#ed and perplexed. So soon as they had retreated #e r#alised #ow urgent and u#avoidable it was to attempt this crossing. #e #urned to Miss Elphinstone, suddenly resolute. "W# m#st go that way," he said, and led the pony round again. #or t#e second time that day this girl proved #er qual#ty. To force #heir way into #he torrent of people, my brother plu#ged into the traffic an# he#d back # cab horse, while she drov# #he pony #cross #ts head. A waggo# loc#ed wheels for # mome#t and ripped a long splinter from the chaise. In anoth#r moment they wer# caught and swept forward by the stre#m. My brother, with the cabman's whip marks red across #is face and han#s, scrambled into the chaise #nd took the #eins from her. "Point the revolver at the man behind," he said, giving i# #o he#, "if #e presses us too ha#d. No!--po#nt it at his horse." Th#n he began to look out for # chance of edging #o the righ# across the road. But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition, #o become a part of that dusty rout. They swept through Chippi#g Barnet with th# t#rrent; they were nearly a mile b#yond #he c#ntre of the town before #hey had fought acr#ss to t#e opposite side of th# way. It was din and c#nfusion indesc#ibable; but #n and beyond th# town the road fork# repeatedly, and this to some extent relieved the stress. They stru#k eastward through Ha#ley, and there on either side of the road, and a# another place farther on they came upo# a gr#at mu#titude of peop#e #rinking at the stream, #ome fighting to co#e a# the water. #nd farther on, fro# a lull #ear East Barnet, th#y sa# tw# trains running slowly one af#er the other #ithout signal o# order--trains swarming with people, with me# even #mong the #oals beh#nd #he engines--going northward along #he Great Northern Ra#lway. My bro#her suppos#s they must have filled outside London, for at that time the furious t#rror o# the people had rendered th# central termini impossible. #ear this place they hal#ed for the #est of the afternoon, for th# violence of the day h#d already utterly exhausted all three of them. They began to s#ffer the beginni#gs of #unger; the night w#s cold, and no#e #f #hem dar#d to sleep. A#d in the evening many people came hurry#ng along the road nearby t#eir stopping pla#e, fleeing fr#m unknown dange#s before them, an# going in the direc#ion from which my brother had come. CHAPTER SEV#NTEEN THE "THUND#R CHILD" Had the Martians aimed only at de#truction, t#ey might on Monday have annihilated the entire population of London, as it spre#d itself slowly through #he hom# counties. N#t only along the road through Barnet, but also through Edgware and Wa#tham A#bey, and a#ong the roads eastwa#d to Southend and Shoeburyness, and south of the Tha#es #o Deal #nd Broadstairs, pou#ed the sa#e frantic rout. If one coul# have hung that June morning i# a balloon in th# blazing blue above London every n#rthward and eastward road running out of #he tangl#d maze of streets would have se#med stippled black with the streaming fugitives, eac# d#t a hu#an agony of terror and physical distress. I have set forth at length in the last chapter my brother's account #f #he road thro#gh C#ipping #arnet, in order that my readers may real#se how that swarming of black dots appeared to one of those concern#d. Ne#er before #n the history of th# world had such a mass of huma# beings moved and suffered together. The legendary host# #f Goths and Huns, the hugest armies Asia has #ver see#, w#uld have be#n but a drop in that current. And th#s w#s #o disciplined march; i# was # stampede--a stampede gigan#ic a#d terribl#--without order and wi#hout a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned, dri#ing headlong. It wa# the beginn#ng of the rout o# civilisation, of the massacre o# mankind. Direc#ly below him the balloonist wou#d have seen the network o# streets f#r and wide, hous#s, churches, squares, crescents, gardens--#lready derelict--spread out like a huge #ap, #nd in #he s#uthward blotted. Ove# Ea#ing, Richmond, Wimbledon, it would #ave seemed as if some mons#rous pen had flung ink upon the chart. Steadily, incessantly, eac# black splash grew a#d #pread, shooting out ramifications this way and that, now banking itself against rising ground, now pourin# swif#ly over # crest into # new-found valley, #xactly a# a go#t of ink #ould spread itself upon bl#tting paper. And beyond, ov#r #he blue hill# that r#se south#ard of the river, the glittering Martians w#nt t# an# fro, calmly and methodically spreading their poison cloud over this patch of country a#d then over tha#, laying it again wit# their stea# j#ts #hen it h#d serv#d its purpose, and taking possession of the conquered country. They #o n#t seem t# have aimed at extermination s# much as at comp#ete demoralisation and the destruction of any opposition. T#ey exploded an# stores of powder t#ey came upon, cut eve#y tel#graph, and wrecked the railways #ere and there. They were ham#tringing #ankind. They se#med i# no hurr# to extend the field of their operations, and did not come beyond the cen#ral part o# London #ll that day. It is possibl# that a very considerable number o# people in London s#uck #o their hous#s through M#nday morning. Ce#tain it #s that ma#y died at #ome suf#ocated b# the Black Smoke. Until #bout midday the P#ol of London was an astonishing sce#e. #teamboats and shipping of #ll #orts lay there, tempted by th# enormous sums of mon#y offered by fugitives, and i# is said that many who swam out to #hese vessels were t#rust of# with boathooks and drowned. About one o'clock in th# afternoon t#e thinning remnant of a cloud of the black vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars Bridg#. A# that the Pool be#ame # scene of mad confusion, fighting, and collision, and for some ti#e a mult#tude of boats an# barges jammed in the northern arch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors and lightermen h#d to fight savagely against t#e people who swarmed upon them fro# t#e riverfront. Peop#e were act#ally clambering down t#e pier# of t#e bridge fro# abov#. When, #n hour later, a Martian appeared beyond the Clock To#er and waded down the river, n#thing bu# wreckage f#oated above Limehouse. Of the fal#ing of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell. The sixth st#r fell at Wimb#edon. My brother, keeping watch beside th# women in the chaise in # meadow, saw th# #reen flash of it far beyond the hil#s. On Tuesday the little party, stil# set upon gett#ng across t#e se#, made its way through the swarming countr# towards Colchester. The news that the Marti#ns #ere n#w i# posses#ion of t#e whole #f London was confirmed. They had been seen at Highgate, and #ven, it #as said, at Neasden. #ut they did #ot come into my brother's view #ntil the morrow. That d#y the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need o# p#ovisions. As they gre# hungry the rights of property ceased to be regarded. Farmers were #ut to defend their cattle-sheds, granaries, and ripening root crops with arms in their hands. # n#mber of people now, like my brother, had their faces east#ard, and there were some desp#rate souls ev#n goi#g bac# towards London to get food. These w#re chiefly people from the northern suburbs, #hose knowledge of #he Bla#k Smoke came by hearsay. H# heard that a#out half the members of the government ha# gather#d at Birmingham, and that enormou# quantities of high explosives w#re being prepared t# be used i# automatic mines across the Midland counties. He wa# also told that the Midla#d Railway Company had repla#ed the desertions #f the first day's panic, had resumed t#affic, and was running northward #rains from S#. Albans t# reli#ve the congestion o# the home counties. Ther# was also a placard in Chipping On#ar announcing that large stores of flour were available i# the #orthern towns and #hat w#thin twenty-#our hou#s bread woul# be distributed am#ng the starving people in the neighbourhood. Bu# this intelligence did not deter him fro# the plan of escape he had formed, an# the three pressed eastward #ll d#y, and heard no more of t#e bread distribution than this promise. N#r, a# a matter of #act, did anyone else hear #ore o# #t. That night fell the seventh star, falling upon Prim#ose Hill. It fell #hile Miss Elp#instone #as watching, for she took that duty alterna#ely with my bro#her. #he saw it. On Wednes#ay the three fugitives--they had pa#sed the ni#ht in a fie#d o# unripe wheat--reached Ch#lmsford, an# the#e a body o# the inhabitants, c#lling itse#f #he Committee #f Public Supply, seized the p#ny a# provisions, and would give nothing in exch#nge f#r it but the promise o# a share in it th# next day. Her# the#e #ere rumours of Martians at E#ping, an# new# of the des#ruction of Waltham Abbey Powder Mills in a vain att#mpt to blow up one of th# invaders. People #ere watching for Martians here fr#m #he church tower#. My br#ther, very luckily for him as it chanced, preferred to pu#h on at #nce to th# coas# rather than wait f#r #ood, although all three of them we#e very hungry. By midday they passed through Tillingham, whi#h, strangely enough, seemed to #e q#ite silent and deserted, #ave for # few furtive plun#erers hunting for food. Ne#r Tillin#ham they suddenly came in sight o# t#e sea, and the #ost amazing crowd of shipping of all sorts that it is possible to imagine. For after the sailors could no longer come up t#e Thames, they came on #o the Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton and Clacton, and afte#wards to Foulness and #hoebury, to bring off #he people. Th#y lay in a huge sickle-shaped curve that vanish#d i#to mist at las# towards t#e N#ze. Close insh#re was # multitude of f#shing smacks--English, Scotch, French, Dutch, and Swedish; steam launches from the Thames, yachts, electric boats; and beyond were ships of #arge bu#den, # multitude of filt#y colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships, passenger boats, pet#oleum tanks, ocean #ramps, an old white transport eve#, neat w#ite and grey liners #rom Southampton and Hamb#rg; an# along the bl#e c#ast across the Blackwater my brother could ma#e out dimly a dense swarm of boats chaffering #ith the people #n the beach, a swarm which a#so exten#ed up #he Blackwater almost to Mal#on. A#out a couple of miles out #ay a# ironclad, very low in the water, almost, to my brother's perception, like # water-logged ship. This was the #am Thunder Child. It was the on#y warsh#p i# sight, but far away to the right #ver #he smooth surfa#e of t#e sea--for that day there was a dead calm--lay # serpent of bl#ck smoke to mark the next ironc#ads of the Channel Fl#et, whic# hovered in an extended line, steam up and #eady for act#on, across the T#ames #stuary during the course o# t#e Martian conqu#st, vigilant a#d yet powerless to prevent it. #t the sight #f the sea, #rs. Elphinsto#e, in spite #f the assurances of her sister-in-law, g#ve way #o panic. She had never been out of England before, she would rather die than trust he#self friendless in a foreign country, and so forth. S#e seemed, p#or woman, to imagine that the French and #he Martians might prove very similar. She ha# been #rowing increasingly hysterical, fearful, and depres#ed during the t#o days' journeyings. Her great idea was to return to S#anmore. T#ings had been alw#ys well and safe at Stanmore. They would find George at Stanmore. It was wit# the greatest difficulty they could get h#r #own to the beach, where presently my brother succeeded #n attracting the attention o# some me# on a paddle steamer fr#m the Thames. They sent a boat and drove a bargain for thirty-six #ounds for the three. The steamer was go#ng, these me# said, to Ostend. It was about t#o o'clock when m# brother, ha#ing paid their fares at the gangway, found himself #afely abo#rd th# stea#boat with his ch#rges. There was food aboard, albeit a# exorbitant prices, and the three of them contrived to eat a meal o# on# of the seats forward. The#e #ere alre#dy a c#uple of sc#re #f passe#gers aboard, #ome of who# had expended their las# money in securing a pass#ge, but the captain lay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon, pi#king up passengers u#til the seated decks #ere even dangerously crowded. He would probab#y have remained lo#ger had it not been for the sound of guns that began about that #our in the sou#h. As if in answer, the #ronclad seaward fired # sma#l gun and hoisted a string of flags. # j#t o# smoke sprang o#t o# #er funnels. Some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from Shoeburyness, until i# was noticed that i# was growing louder. At the same time, far away in the southeast t#e mas#s and upperworks of three ironcl#ds r#se #ne a#ter t#e other #ut of th# sea, beneath clouds o# black smoke. But m# brother's attention speedily reverte# to the distant firing in the south. He fancied he saw a column of smoke rising out of the distant gr#y haz#. #he little steamer was already #lapping h#r way eastward of the big crescent of shipping, and the low E#sex coast was grow#ng bl#e and hazy, when a Martian a#peared, #mall and faint in the remote d#stance, advancing alo#g the muddy coas# from the direction of Foulness. At th#t the captain on the bridg# swore at t#e #op of hi# voice with #ear and #nger a# hi# ow# delay, and the pa#dles seemed infected with his terror. Every so#l aboard stood a# #he bulwarks o# on the se#ts #f t#e steamer and stared at that distant shape, higher t#an the trees or chu#ch towers inl#nd, and advan#ing with a leisurely parody of # hu#an stride. I# w#s the first Martian my br#ther had seen, and he stood, more amazed than terrified, watching thi# Titan advancing deliberately towards #he shippin#, wadi#g farther and farther into the wa#er as the coas# fell away. Then, #ar awa# beyond the Crouch, ca#e another, striding over some stunted trees, and #hen yet another, still farther off, wading deeply through a shiny mudf#at that seemed to #ang halfway up between sea and sky. #hey w#re all #talking seaward, as if t# intercept th# escape of the multitudinous vessels tha# were crowded between Foulness and the Naze. In spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines o# the littl# paddle-boat, and the pouring f#am that h#r wheels flung behind he#, s#e receded with terrif#ing slowne#s from this #minous advance. Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the larg# crescent of shipping already writhin# with the #pproaching terror; one sh#p passi#g #ehind another, anothe# coming round from broadside to en# on, steamships whistling and giving o#f volumes o# ste#m, sails being let out, lau#ches r#shing hither a#d thither. He was so fascinated by #his and b# the #reeping danger away to the left that he #ad no eyes for anything seaward. And then # swift movem#nt of #he steamboat #he #ad suddenl# come round to avoid being ru# down flung him headlong from the seat upon which he was standing. There was # shouting a#l about him, a trampling of feet, and # cheer th#t seemed t# be answered faintly. The steamboat lurched and rolled h#m over upon his hands. He sprang t# his feet and saw to starboard, #nd no# # hundred #ards from their heeling, pi#ching boat, a vast i#on #ulk like the #lade of a plough tea#ing throu#h the water, tossing i# on either si#e in huge waves of foam that leaped tow#rds the steamer, flinging her paddles helplessly in th# a#r, an# then sucking he# deck down almost to th# waterline. A dou#he o# spray blinded m# brother for a moment. Wh#n his eyes wer# cle#r again he sa# th# monster had passed and #as rushi#g landward. Big iron upperworks ros# out of this headlong structure, and #rom that twin funne#s projected a#d s#at # #moking bl#st shot wi#h fire. I# was the torpedo ram, Thunder Ch#ld, steaming #eadlong, coming to the rescue of #he threatened shipping. Keeping #is footing #n the h#aving deck by clutching the bulwarks, my br#ther looked past this chargi#g leviat#an at the Martians again, and he saw the three of them now clos# together, and standin# so far ou# to se# that their tripod supports we#e almost entirely submerged. #hus #unken, and seen #n remote perspective, they appeared far less formidable than th# huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer wa# pitching s# helplessly. It would see# th#y were regarding this new antagonist with #stonishment. To their intelligence, it #ay b#, the giant wa# even #uch another as themselves. T#e Thunder C#ild f#red no gu#, but s#mply drove full speed towards them. I# was probably her not firing that enabled he# #o get so near the enemy as she did. They #id no# know what to make #f her. One shel#, an# th#y would have sent her t# the bott#m forthwi#h with #he Heat-Ray. She was steaming at such a pace that i# a min#te sh# seemed halfway between the steamboat #nd the Martians--a diminishing bla#k bulk against the receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast. Suddenly the foremost #artian lowered his tube and discharged # canist#r o# the b#ack gas at t#e ironclad. It hit her larboard side and glanced of# i# #n inky je# that rolled away to seaward, an unfolding torrent of #lack Smoke, from which #he ironclad dr#ve #lear. To the w#tchers from the steamer, l#w in the wat#r a#d wi#h the sun in their eyes, it seemed as though sh# we#e already among #he Martians. They saw t#e gaunt figures separati#g a#d rising out of the water as they retreated shoreward, and #ne #f them ra#sed #he camera-#ike generator of the Heat-Ray. #e hel# it pointi#g o#liquely downward, a#d # bank of steam sprang from the water a# it# touch. I# must have driven through the iron of the ship's side like a white-hot iron rod through pa#er. A flicke# of flame went up through the rising #team, and then the Martian reeled #nd staggered. In ano#her moment #e was cut down, and a great body of water #nd s#eam sho# high in the air. The guns of the Thunder Child sou#ded through the reek, going off one after the o#her, and one s#ot splashed the water h#gh #lose by #he steamer, ricocheted towar#s the other flying ships to the north, and smashed a sma#k to matchwood. #ut n# one heeded that very much. At #he sight of the Martian's collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately, a#d all the crowding passe#gers on th# steamer's ste#n shouted tog#ther. And #hen they yelled again. Fo#, surging out #eyond the white tum#lt, drove something long #nd black, the flames str#aming fro# it# middle parts, it# ventilators and funnels spouting fire. She was alive still; the steering gear, i# s#ems, was intact a#d her engines wo#king. #he headed straight for a seco#d M#rtian, and was within # hundred yards o# him when the Heat-Ray came to bear. Then with a vi#lent thu#, # bli#ding flash, her decks, her funnels, leaped upward. The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion, an# in another moment #he fl#ming wreckage, still dr#ving forward w#th t#e impetus of its pace, h#d struck him a#d crumpled him u# like a thing of cardb#ard. My brother shouted #nvoluntarily. A boiling #umult of steam hid everythin# #gain. "Two!" yelled the c#ptain. Everyone was shouting. The whole steamer from end to end rang with frantic cheering that wa# taken up firs# by one an# #hen by a#l in #he crow#ing multi#ude of ships and boats #hat wa# driving out to sea. Th# steam hu#g #pon the water for many min#tes, hiding the third Mart#an and the co#st altogether. And all this #ime the boa# was paddling steadily #ut t# sea and away fr#m the fig#t; and when at last the confusion clea#ed, the drifti#g bank of black va#our intervened, and nothing of t#e Thunder Child could #e made out, nor could the third Martian be seen. But the ironcla#s to #eaward were n#w quite close and standi#g i# #owards #hore past th# steamboat. The little vessel continued to beat its w#y seawa#d, and the iro#clads receded slowly towar#s the coast, which was hidden still by a marbled bank of vapo#r, part ste#m, p#rt black gas, ed#ying and combining in the strangest way. T#e fl#et #f refugees w#s scattering t# the northeast; sever#l #macks were sailin# between the ironclads and #he steamboat. A#ter # time, and b#fore th#y reached the sinking clo#d bank, the warships turne# northward, #nd then abruptly we#t ab#ut and passed into the thickening haze of evening southw#rd. T#e coas# grew faint, and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of #louds t#at #ere gatherin# #bout the sinking sun. Then suddenly out #f the golden haze of t#e sunset ca#e th# vibration o# guns, a#d a form of bl#ck shadows moving. Everyone struggled t# the rail #f the st#amer and peered i#to the blinding furnace of the west, bu# nothing was to be distinguished clearly. A mass of #moke #ose slanting and barred #he face #f the sun. The steam#oat th#obbed on its way throug# an interminable suspense. The s#n sank into grey c#ouds, the sky flushed and darkened, th# evening star t#embled into sight. It was deep twilight #hen the captain cried out a#d pointed. M# brother strained #is eyes. Something rushe# #p into the sky ou# of the greyness--rushed slan#ingly upward and very swiftly in#o the lu#inous clearness above the clouds in the western sky; something flat and broad, and very lar#e, th#t swept ro#nd i# # vast #urve, gre# smaller, sank slowly, a#d vanished again in#o the grey mystery of the night. #nd a# #t flew it rai#ed down darkness upon the land. BOOK TWO #HE EARTH UNDER THE MARTIANS CHAPTER ONE UNDER FOOT In the first book I have wandered so much fro# my own ad#entures to t#ll of the experienc#s of my br#ther that a#l through the last two chapters I and the curate have been lurking i# the em#ty house at Halliford whithe# we fle# to escape th# Black S#oke. There # will resume. W# stopped there all Sunday night a#d all #he ne#t day--the day o# the panic--in a litt#e island of daylight, cut off by the Blac# Smoke from the rest #f the world. We could do no#hing but wait i# aching inactivity during those two weary days. M# mind was occupied by anxiety for m# wife. I figured her at L#atherhead, ter#ified, i# danger, mou#ning me already as a dead man. I paced th# rooms and c#ied aloud w#en I thought of how I was cut off fr#m her, o# #ll that might happen to her in my absence. #y cousin # knew was brave enough for #ny emergency, #ut h# was not the sort of man to realise danger qui#kly, to r#se promptly. What was need#d no# #as not brav#ry, bu# circ#mspection. My on#y con#olation was t# believe that the Martians were moving London-ward and away from her. Such vague anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful. I grew very weary an# irritable with the curate's perpetual ejaculations; I tire# of t#e sight of hi# selfi#h despair. A#ter some ineffectual remonstrance I kept away from him, s#aying in a room--evidently # children's schoolroom--containing globes, forms, #nd copybooks. When he followed me thit#er, # #ent to a box room #t the top of t#e house a#d, in order to be alone with my aching miseries, locked myself in. We were hopelessly hemmed i# by the Black Smoke all t#at day an# the mornin# of the next. There were signs of people in th# next hous# #n Sunday evening--a f#ce at a window and mov#ng lig#ts, an# later the slamming o# a door. But I do not know who these p#ople were, nor what becam# o# them. We #aw nothing of them next da#. The Black Smoke drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer and nearer to us, driving at la#t along the roadway outside #he house that hid us. A Ma#tian came across the fields abo#t midday, layin# th# stuff #ith # j#t #f superheated st#am that hissed against the walls, smashed all the windows #t touched, a#d scalded the curate's hand #s he fled out of the front room. When at last we crept #cross the sodden rooms #nd looked ou# again, #he country northward was as though a black snowstorm ha# passe# over it. Looking towards the river, we were astonished to see a# unaccountable redness mingling with the bl#ck of the s#orched meadows. For a time we #id not see how th#s change #ffected #ur #osition, save tha# we were relieved of #ur fear o# the Black Smoke. B#t later I perceived that we were no longer #emmed in, that now we might get away. So soon as I realised that t#e way #f escape was open, my dream o# action #eturned. Bu# the #urate was lethargic, unreasonable. "We are #afe here," he repeated; "safe here." I resolved to leave him--would that # had! Wiser now f#r th# artilleryman's teac#ing, I sou#ht out food and drink. # had fou#d #il and rags for my #urns, and I also took a hat and a flannel shirt that I fou#d in one #f the bedrooms. When it was clear to him that I meant t# go alone--had reconciled myself to going alone--#e sudde#ly roused h#mself to come. And al# being #uiet throughout #he afternoon, we started about five o'clock, #s I should judge, along the b#ackened road #o Sunbury. #n S#nbury, and at intervals #long the road, were dead bo#ies lying in contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and luggage, all covere# thickly wi#h #lack dus#. That pall of cindery powder made me think of what # had read #f the destruction of Pompeii. We got to Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds full of stra#ge an# #nfamiliar appearances, and a# Hampton Court #ur eyes were relieved to find # patch of green that had #scaped the suffocating drift. #e went th#ough #ushey Park, w#th i#s de#r g#ing #o and f#o under t#e chestnuts, and som# men and women hurrying i# the distance towa#ds Hampton, an# so we came to Twickenham. Thes# were the first #eople w# saw. Away a#ross the ro#d #he woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still afire. Twickenham wa# uninjured by either Heat-Ray o# #lack Smoke, and there were mor# peop#e about h#re, though non# could give us news. For the most part t#ey were like ourselves, #aking #dvantage of a lull to s#ift their quarters. I have an impression that many of the h#uses here were still occupied by #cared inha#itants, too frighten#d even fo# flight. Here too t#e evidence of a #asty rout #as abund#nt along #he road. I r#member most vividly three sm#shed bicycles in # heap, pounded #nto the #oad b# th# wheels of subsequent carts. We #rossed Richmond Br#dge abo#t half past eight. We hur#ied acr#ss the exposed bridge, of course, bu# I noticed floating down #he stream a n#mber of #ed mas#es, some many feet across. # did not k#ow what these were--there was n# time for scrutiny--and I put a more h#rrible interpret#tion on them than they deserved. Here again on the Surrey si#e were bl#ck dus# t#at had o#ce been smoke, a#d dead bodies--a hea# near t#e approach to the sta#ion; but we had no glimpse of t#e Martians until we were some way towards #arnes. We saw in the blackened distance a gr#up o# three people running down # side street towards #he riv#r, but otherwise it seemed deserted. Up the h#ll Richmond tow# was burning briskly; #utside the town of #ichmond #here was n# trace of the Black Smoke. Then s#ddenly, as we approached Kew, came # numbe# of people running, a#d th# upperworks #f a Martian fighting-machine loomed i# sight over #he housetops, n#t # hundred yar#s away from us. W# stood aghast at our danger, and had the Martian looked down we must immediately h#ve perished. We were so #errified that we dared not go on, but turned aside and hi# i# # shed in a garden. There t#e curate crouched, weeping silently, #nd refusing to #tir again. But #y fixed idea #f reaching Leatherhead would not let me rest, and in the twilight I vent#red out again. I went through # shrubbery, a#d along a passage beside a big house standing in its ow# gr#unds, and so emer#ed upon the road to#ards Kew. The curate I left in the shed, but he came hurrying after me. That second s#art was t#e most foolhardy thing # ever did. For it was manifest the Martians were about us. No sooner h#d the curate overtake# m# than we #aw eith#r the fighting-machine we had seen befor# or another, far #way across the mea#ows in the direction of Kew Lodg#. Four o# five li#tle black figures hurried befor# it across the green-grey of the field, and i# a moment it w#s evident this Martian pursued them. In three strides he was among them, and they ran radiating from his #eet in #ll direc#ions. #e used no Heat-Ray to des#roy them, but picke# #hem u# one #y one. Apparently he tosse# #hem into the great met#llic carrier which projected beh#nd him, much as # workman's basket hangs over his #houlder. I# #as the first time I realised #hat the Martians might have any other purp#se than destruction wit# defeated humanity. We stood for a mome#t petrified, then turned and fled thro#gh a gate behind us #nto # wal#ed garden, fell into, rather th#n found, a fortunate ditch, and lay t#ere, scarce daring to whisper to each oth#r until #he star# were out. I suppose it was nearl# eleven o'clock before we gathered courage to s#art aga#n, no longer venturi#g into the road, but sneaking along hedgerows an# t#rough plantations, and watching keenly through the darkness, he on the right and I on the left, for t#e Martians, #ho se#med to b# all ab#ut us. In one place w# blundered upon a scorched and blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scatt#red dea# bodies of me#, burned horribly abou# th# heads and t#unks but with their l#gs and boots mostly intact; and o# #ead hors#s, fifty feet, perhaps, behind # line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages. Sheen, #t seemed, had escaped destruction, bu# the place was silent and deserted. Here w# happene# on #o dead, thou#h the night was too dark f#r us to see into the side roads of th# #lace. In Sheen my companion suddenly complained of faintness and thir#t, and we deci#ed to try one of the houses. The first #ouse we entered, after a litt#e difficulty #ith the window, was a small semi-d#tached villa, an# I found nothing eatable l#ft in #he place but some mouldy cheese. There was, however, water to drink; and I took a hatchet, which promised to be #seful in #ur next house-breaking. We then crossed to a place w#ere the road t#rns towards Mortlake. Here ther# stood a white ho#se withi# a walled garden, and i# the pantry o# this domicile w# fo#nd a store #f f#od--two loav#s of bread #n a pan, an #ncooked steak, and the ha#f of # ham. # #ive this catalogue so precisely #ecause, as it happened, we were destined to subsist upon t#is store for the #ext fortnight. Bottled be#r st#od under a shelf, and there wer# tw# bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces. This pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and #n this w#s firewo#d; there was also a cupboard, in wh#ch #e found n#arly a dozen of burgundy, tinn#d soups and #almon, a#d t#o tins of biscuits. We sa# in the adjacent kitchen i# the dark--for we dared not strike a li#ht--and #te bread and ham, a#d drank beer out o# the same b#ttle. T#e curate, who was still timoro#s #nd restless, was #ow, oddly enough, for push#ng #n, and I was urging him to kee# up his strength by eating when the thing happened that was to imprison us. "It can't be #idnight yet," I sa#d, a#d then came a blinding glare of vivid green light. Everything in t#e k#tchen leaped out, clearly visible in green and black, and vanished agai#. And then followed such a concussion as I h#ve never heard before or since. So c#ose on the hee#s #f this as to seem instantaneous cam# a thud behind me, a cl#sh of gl#ss, a crash #nd rattle of falling masonry all about us, and the plaster of th# ceiling came down upon us, sm#shing into a multitude of fragment# upon our heads. I was knocked headlong acro#s the floor against the oven handle and stunned. I was insensible for a lo#g time, the curate told me, and when I came to #e w#re in da#kness again, and he, #ith a #ace w#t, as # found afterwards, with blood from # cut forehead, #as dabbing water over me. For some time I coul# no# rec#llect #hat h#d happene#. Then things ca#e to me slowly. A bruise on my temple #sserted itse#f. "#re y#u better?" asked the curate in a whi#per. A# l#st # answered him. I sat up. "#on't move," he said. "The floor is covered with smashed #rockery from #he dresser. You can'# possibly move wit#out making # noi#e, and I fancy they are outside." We both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each other breathing. Everything seemed deadly st#ll, but once something near #s, some plaster o# broken brickwork, slid #own with a rumbling sound. #utside and very ne#r was a# interm#ttent, metallic rattle. "That!" said the cur#te, when presently it happened again. "Yes," I said. "But wh#t is it?" "A Mart#an!" #aid the curate. I liste#ed a#ain. "#t was not like the He#t-Ray," I said, and for a time I was inclined #o think one of the great fighting-machines h#d stumbled ag#inst the house, as I had seen one stumble against #he towe# of Shepperton Church. Our situation wa# so strang# and incomprehensible that for three #r four ho#rs, #ntil the dawn came, we scarcely m#ved. And then the light filte#ed in, not through the wi#dow, which remai#ed black, but through a triangular aperture between # beam an# # heap of broken br#cks in the wall behind us. #he in#erior o# the kitch#n we now sa# gr#yly for the first time. Th# window #ad been burst in b# a ma#s of garden moul#, which flowed over the table #pon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet. Outsi#e, the so#l was banked high against #he hou#e. At the top of the window fr#me we #ould see an uprooted drainpipe. The floor was litte#ed with smashed hardware; th# end of the kitchen towards th# #ouse was broken into, a#d since the daylight shone in t#ere, it was evident the great#r part of the house had collapsed. Contrasting viv#dly with this ruin was the neat dresser, stained in #he fashion, pale green, and with a number #f copper and tin ves#els below it, the wallpaper #mitating blu# and w#ite tiles, and # c#uple of coloured supplements fluttering from the walls above t#e kitchen range. As the dawn grew clearer, we saw through th# gap in th# wall th# body of a Martian, st#nding sentinel, # suppose, over the stil# glowing cylinder. At the sight #f that we crawled as circumspectly as possible out of the twilight of the kitchen into #he darkness of the scullery. Abruptly th# right interpretation dawne# upon m# m#nd. "Th# fifth cylinder," # whispere#, "the fifth #hot from Ma#s, has struck this house and burie# us under the ruins!" For # t#me th# curate was silent, and the# h# whispered: "God hav# mercy upon us!" I heard #im presently whimpering to himself. Sa#e for that sound we #ay quit# still in the scul#ery; # for my part s#arce dared breathe, and s#t with my eyes fixed o# the faint light #f the ki#chen door. # coul# just #ee the curate's face, a dim, ov#l shape, and his colla# and cuffs. Outside there bega# a metallic hammering, then a #iolent hooting, and then again, after a quiet interval, a hissing like the hi#sing o# a# engine. These #oises, for the most part problematical, continue# intermittently, and seemed if anything to increase in number as time wo#e on. Presently a measured th#dding a#d a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the vessels in the pa#try ring and shift, began and continued. Once the #ight wa# eclipsed, and #he ghostly kitchen doorw#y became absolutely d#rk. For many hours we must #ave crouched ther#, silent and shivering, until our tire# attenti#n failed... At last I found myself awake and very hungry. I am inclined to #elieve we must have spent th# greater portion of # day before #hat awaken#ng. M# hunger was at a stride #o insistent that it moved #e to action. # told the curate I w#s going to seek food, a#d felt my way towards the pantry. He ma#e me no answer, bu# so soo# #s # b#gan eating the fain# noise # m#de #tirred him up and I heard him crawling after me. CHAPTER TWO WHAT WE #AW FROM THE R#INED HOUSE Aft#r eating #e c#ept ba#k to the scullery, an# there I must #ave dozed a#ain, for when present#y I looked round I was alone. The thudding vibration continued with wearisom# persistence. # whispered for #he curate severa# times, an# at las# felt my w#y to #he door of the kitchen. It was still daylight, #nd I perceived him acr#ss the room, ly#ng against the triangular hole #hat looked out upon #he Martians. His shoulders w#re hunched, so that his head was #idden fr#m me. I could hear a number of noises almost like those #n a# engine shed; and the place rocked with that beating thud. Through the aperture in the wall I could #ee the #op of a tree touched with gold and t#e war# blue of a tranquil evening sky. For a minute or so I remained watching #he curate, and th#n I adv#nced, crouching and stepping with extrem# care amid the broken crockery that littered the floor. I touched the curate's l#g, and he started so violently that a mass #f plaster w#nt sliding down outside an# fell with a loud impact. I gripped his arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a lon# ti#e we crouched motionless. Then I turned to see how much of o#r rampart rem#ined. The detachment #f the pl#ster had left # v#rtical slit o#en in the debris, and by #aising my#elf cautiously across a beam I was able to see ou# of this gap into what had be#n ove#night a #uiet suburban roadway. Vast, indeed, w#s the change t#at we beheld. The fifth cylinder must have fallen right #nto the midst of t#e house we had first visited. The building had vanished, completely smashed, pulverised, and dispersed b# the blow. The cy#inder #ay n#w #ar beneath #he origina# fo#ndations--deep in a hole, already v#stly larger than the pit I #ad lo#ked into at Woking. The ea#th all round it had splashed under that treme#dous impact--"#plashed" is the #nly word--and la# in heap#d piles that hid the #asses #f the adjacent houses. #t had behaved exa#tly like m#d under #he violent blow of # ha#mer. O#r house had collap#ed backward; the front portion, even on the ground flo#r, #ad be#n destroyed completely; b# a chance the kitchen and scullery #ad escaped, and stood buried now un#er so#l and ruins, closed in #y tons of earth on every side save towards the cylinder. Over that aspec# we #ung now on t#e very edg# of the great circula# #it #he Martians #ere engaged in making. Th# heavy beating sound was evidently just beh#nd #s, and ever and agai# a bright green vapour drove up like a veil acro#s #ur peephole. The cylinder was already opened in #he centre of the pit, and on the farth#r edge of t#e pit, a#id the smashed and grav#l-heaped s#rubbery, one of the gre#t fighting-machin#s, deserted by its occu#ant, stood stiff and #all against the evening sky. At f#rst I scarcely noticed th# pit #nd t#e cylinder, although it has been convenient to describe them first, #n account of the extraordinar# glittering mechanism I saw busy i# the excavation, and o# account of th# stran#e creatures that were crawling slowly and painfully acros# the heape# mould near it. The mechanism it c#rtainly was that held my attention first. It was one #f those complicated fabrics that have since b#en called handling-#achines, and the study of which has already given #uch an enormous impetus to terres#rial inven#ion. As i# dawned upon me first, i# presen#ed a sort of metallic spider with five jointed, agile legs, and with a# extraord#nary number o# jointed levers, b#rs, and reaching a#d clutching tentacles about its body. Most of its arms were retracted, but with three long tentacles it w#s fishi#g out # numbe# of rods, plates, and bars w#ich #ined t#e covering and apparently strengthened th# walls of the cylinder. These, as it extracted them, we#e #ifted out and deposited upon a level surface of earth behind it. Its m#tion was s# swift, complex, and perfect tha# a# first I di# not se# it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter. The fighting-machines wer# coordinated and animate# #o #n extraordinary pitch, but n#thing to compare with this. Pe#ple w#o h#ve never #een th#se structures, and have only th# ill-imagined efforts of arti#ts o# th# imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself #o go upon, scarcely realise that living quality. I recall particularly t#e illustr#tion of one of the first pamphlets to give a consecutive account o# the war. The artist had evidently m#de a h#sty study of #ne of t#e fighting-machines, and there his knowl#dge ende#. He presented them a# tilted, stiff tripods, without either flexibility or subtlety, and with an altogether misleading mo#otony o# effect. The pamphlet containing th#se renderings had a considerable vogue, and # mention t#em here simply to warn the reader against the impression they may have created. They were #o more like the Ma#tians I saw i# action than a Dutch do#l is like a human bein#. To my #ind, the pamphlet would have been much better without them. At first, I say, the handling-machine did not imp#ess m# as a machine, but as a crablike creature with a glittering integ#ment, the controlling Marti#n #hose delicate tentacles actuated its m#vements seeming t# be simply the equivalent of the crab's cerebral portion. But then # perceived the rese#blance o# its grey-brown, shiny, leathery integument to that of th# o#her sprawling bodi#s beyond, an# th# true nature of this dexterous wo#kman da#ned u#on me. With that realisation #y int#rest shifted to those ot#er creatures, the #eal Martians. Already I had had a transient impre#sion of these, and t#e first nausea #o longer obscured #y o#servation. Moreover, I was concealed and motionless, #nd under no urgency of ac#ion. They were, # #ow saw, the mo#t unearthly creature# it is possible to concei#e. They were huge round bodies--or, rather, heads--about four feet #n diameter, each b#dy #aving #n front of i# a face. #his fa#e had n# nostrils--indeed, the Martians do not s#em to have had a#y sense of smell, but it had # pair of very large dark-coloured eyes, and just beneath this # kind of fle#hy beak. In the #ack #f th#s head or body--I scarcely know ho# to speak o# it--was the single tight tympanic surface, since known to be anatomically an ear, though it must have been almost useless in our dense air. #n a group ro#nd the mou#h wer# sixte#n slender, #lmost whiplike tentacle#, arranged i# two bunches of eight each. These bunches have since been named rather aptl#, #y tha# distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the h#nds. Even #s I s#w these Martians for the first time they seemed to be #ndeavouring #o raise themsel#es on these hands, but of course, with the increased weight of terrestrial conditions, this was imp#ssible. There i# reason to suppose that o# Mars the# may have progressed upon t#em wi#h some facility. The internal anatomy, I may remark here, a# dissection has since shown, was almost equa#ly si#ple. #he greater p#rt of the struc#ure was the brain, sendi#g enormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile tentacles. Besides this were th# bulky lungs, into which the mouth opened, and the he#rt and it# vessels. The pul#onary distress caused by the den#er atmosphere an# greater #ravitational attraction was only too evident in the convulsive movements #f #he outer skin. And th#s w#s #he #um #f the Marti#n organs. Strang# as it may seem to a human being, all the com#lex apparat#s of digestion, which m#kes up the bulk of our bodies, did not exis# #n the Martians. Th#y we#e heads--merely heads. Entrails they had none. The# d#d not eat, muc# less digest. Instead, the# took th# fresh, livi#g blood of other creatures, and injected #t into their own veins. I have myself se#n t#is be#ng done, a# # sha#l mention in its place. But, squeamish a# I may seem, I cannot bring #yself t# descri#e what I could not endure even to continue watching. Let it #uffice to say, blood obtained from a still living animal, in most cas#s #rom a human being, was run directly by means of a little #ipette into the recipient canal... The bare idea o# this is no doubt h#rribly repulsive to us, but at the same time I think that we should remember how repulsive #ur carnivorous h#bits would seem to an intelligent rabbit. The physiological advantages o# th# practice of injection are undenia#le, i# one thinks o# the tremendous wast# o# human time and energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process. O#r #odies #re #alf ma#e up of gland# #nd tubes and organs, occ#pied in turn#ng heterogeneous food into blood. The digestive processe# an# their reaction upon th# #ervous sys#em sap #ur strength an# colour our #inds. Men go happy o# miserable #s th#y have healthy or unhealthy livers, or so#nd gastric glands. #ut the #artians were lifted above all these organic fluctuations of #ood and emotion. Their undeniable preference for men as thei# source of nourishment is partl# explained by the nat#re of the remains o# t#e victi#s they had brought with them as provisions fro# Mars. These creatures, to judge from the shri#elled remains that have fall#n int# human hands, were bipeds with flimsy, silicious skel#tons almost like those of the silicious sponges and feeble musculature, standing about si# feet high and #aving round, erect head#, and large eye# in flinty sock#ts. Two or #hree o# t#ese seem to #ave bee# brought in each c#linder, #nd all were killed before earth wa# reach#d. It was just as well for the#, f#r the mere attempt #o stand upright u#on o#r planet would have broken every bone in their bo#ies. And while I a# engaged in this description, I may add in this place certain furt#er details which, although they were not all evident to us a# the tim#, will enab#e the reader wh# is unacquainted with #hem to form a clearer pictur# o# these offensive creatures. In #hree other #oints their physiology differed strangely from ou#s. Thei# organisms did not sleep, a#y more than the heart o# man sleeps. Since they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate, that #eriodical extinction was unknown to them. T#ey #ad little or n# sense of fatigue, it w#uld see#. On ear#h they could #ever have moved without effort, ye# even to the la#t th#y kept in action. #n twenty-four hours they did twenty-four hours of work, as even on earth is perhap# t#e ca#e #ith the ants. In the next place, wonder#ul as it seems in a sexual world, the Martians were absolutely without sex, and therefore without any of the tumultuous em#tions t#at ar#se f#om that #ifference among men. A young Martian, ther# #an now be no dispute, was really born upon earth during the war, and it was found attached to its parent, partially bu#ded off, just as young lilybulbs #ud off, or like #he young animals in the fre#h-water polyp. I# man, in all the higher terres#rial animals, such a method #f increase has disappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly the primi#ive metho#. Among the lower animals, up even to those first cousins of the vertebrated animals, t#e Tunicates, the t#o processes occur side by sid#, but finally t#e s#xual met#od superseded #ts competitor altogether. #n Mars, however, just the re#erse has apparently been #he case. It i# wo#thy of remark that a certain specul#tive writer of quasi-sci#ntific reput#, writing lon# before the Mart#an invasion, #id forecast #or man # f#nal structure not unlik# the #ctual Martian condition. His prophecy, I remem#er, appeared #n November or December, #893, in a long-defunct pu#lication, the Pall Mall Budge#, and I recall # caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical call#d Punch. He pointed out--writing in a foolish, fac#tious ton#--that the perfection of mechanical appliances #ust ultimately supersede lim#s; t#e perfection of #hemical devices, digestion; #hat such org#ns as ha#r, external nose, tee#h, #ars, and chin were no long#r essential parts of #he human being, a#d that the tendency of natural selection would #ie in th# direction of their steady diminution thr#ugh the coming ages. The b#ain alon# remained a c#rdinal necessity. Only #ne other part of t#e #ody h#d a #trong case f#r survival, and that wa# t#e hand, "teacher and agent of the brain." While the rest of the b#dy dwindled, the ha#ds woul# grow larger. There is many a true word written #n jest, and here in the Martians we hav# beyond dispute #he actual accomplishment #f such a sup#ression o# th# animal side of the organism b# #he intelligence. To me it is qu#te credible that the Martian# may be descended from be#ngs not unlike ourselv#s, b# a gradual development o# brain and hand# the latt#r giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles a# last at the expense #f #he rest of t#e body. Withou# the body the brain would, #f course, becom# a mere selfish intelligence, without any #f the em#tional #ubstratum o# #he human being. The last salient point #n #hich the systems of these creatures differed from #urs was in wha# one might have thought # very trivial particular. Micro-organism#, which cause so much disease and pain on earth, #ave ei#her #ever appeared upon Mars or Mart#an sanitary science eliminated them ages ago. A hu#dred dise#ses, a#l the fe#ers an# conta#ions o# human life, c#nsumption, c#ncers, tumours and such morbidities, neve# ent#r #he sc#eme of #heir l#fe. And speaking of the differences between the lif# on Mar# #nd terrestrial life, I may al#ude here t# the cu#ious suggestions o# the red weed. Apparently the #egetable kingdom in Mars, instead of ha#ing green #or # dominant colou#, is #f # vivi# bl#od-red tint. At any #ate, #he seeds which the Mart#ans intentionally or accidenta#ly brought #ith them gave rise in all cases #o red-col#ured growths. Only that known popularl# #s the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition w#th t#rrestrial #orms. The red creeper was quite # transitory growth, and f#w people have seen it growing. For # time, #owever, the red weed #rew wi#h astonishing vigour and luxuriance. It spread up the sides of the pit by #he third o# fourth day of our imprisonment, and its cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edg#s of ou# triangular wi#dow. And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout the #ountry, an# especi#lly wherever there was a stream #f water. T#e Ma#tians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a sin#le round dru# at #he ba#k of the h#ad-body, and e#es with # visual range not very di#ferent #rom our# except that, according t# Philip#, blue and violet were as black to them. It i# commonly supposed that they #ommunicated b# sounds and tentacular gesticulations; #his is asserted, for instance, in t#e able but hastily com#iled pamphlet written evidently by someone not an eye-witness of Martian #ctions t# wh#ch I have already alluded, and which, so far, ha# been the chief source o# information concerning the#. No# no surviving human being saw so much of t#e Martians #n action #s I did. I take no cre#it to myself fo# an accident, but the fact i# so. And # asser# th#t I w#tched them closely time after time, and that # h#ve see# fou#, five, and once six of them sluggishly perform#ng the most elaborately complicated operations t#gether without eith#r sound or gestur#. Their #eculiar hooti#g invariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation, and was, I believe, in no sen#e # signal, but merely the expiration of air preparatory #o the suctional #peration. I have a certain claim to at le#st an elementary kn#wledge o# psy#hology, and in this #atter I am convinced--as firmly as I a# convinced of anything--that #he Martians interchanged thoughts without any physical inter#ediation. #nd # have been convinced o# this in spite of strong preconceptions. Before the Martian invasion, as an occasional reader here or t#ere ma# remember, I had wr#tten with some little vehemence against t#e telepathic theo#y. #he #artians wore n# c#othing. Their conceptions #f ornament and decorum were necessarily dif#erent from o#rs; and not o#ly were they evidently much less sensible o# chang#s #f #emperature th#n w# are, but changes of pressure do not s#em to have affected their health at al# seriously. Yet thou#h they wo#e no clothing, it #as in t#e other artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great superiority over man #ay. We men, with our b#cycles and road-skat#s, ou# Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and stic#s and so forth, are just in #he beginning of t#e ev#lution that t#e Martians have worked out. #hey have become practically me#e brains, wearing different b#dies according to their needs jus# as m#n wear s#its of clothes and take a bicycle in a hu#ry or #n umbrella in the wet. And of their appliances, perhaps nothing i# more wonderful to a man t#an the #urious fact that what is the dominant feature of a#most all hum#n devic#s in mechanism is abse#t--the #heel #s absent; #mong all #he things they brought to #arth there i# #o trace or suggestion of their use #f wheels. One would have at least expected it in locomotion. And in this connection it is #urious to re#ark that ev#n on this earth Na#ure h#s nev#r hit #pon the wheel, or #as preferred #ther expedients to its development. And not only did the Martians #ither not #now of which is incredible, or abstain from, the whee#, but in their apparatus singularly little use is made of #he fixed pivot o# relati#ely fixed pivot, with circular motions th#reabout confine# to #ne plane. Almost al# the #oints of the machinery pre#ent # compli#ated system #f sliding par#s movi#g over small bu# beautifully curved friction bearings. And while up#n this matte# of deta#l, it is remarkable #hat the long leverages of the#r machines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of t#e disks in an elastic sheath; these disks be#ome polarised a#d drawn close#y and powerful#y together when traversed by # current of electricity. In this way the cu#ious parallelism to animal motions, which was so striking and disturbing to the hu#an beholder, w#s a#tained. S#ch qua#i-muscles abounded in th# crablike handling-machine which, on #y first peeping out of th# slit, I wat#hed unpac#ing t#e cylinde#. It seemed infinitely #ore alive than the actual Martians lying beyond it #n the sunset lig#t, panting, stirring ineffectual tentacles, and moving feebly after their vas# journey across space. While # #as still watching their sluggish motions in the sun#ight, and noting each strange detail o# their form, the curate reminded me of his presence by pulling violently at my arm. I turned #o a scowling face, and silent, eloquent lips. He wanted t#e slit, which permitted only one of us #o peep throu#h; and s# I #ad to fore#o watching them for a time while he e#joyed that p#ivilege. When I looked again, the #usy handling-machine had already pu# together several of the pi#ces of apparatus i# ha# taken out of #he cylinder int# # shape having an unmist#kable likeness #o its own; and down #n the left # busy l#ttle digging mechanism had c#me in#o view, emitting jet# of #reen va#our and working its way round the pit, excavating #nd embanking #n # methodical and discriminating manner. This it was which had caused #he regular beating noise, and the rhythmic shocks t#at h#d kept #ur ruinous refuge quivering. It piped and whis#led as it worked. So f#r #s I could s#e, the th#ng was without a directing Martian a# all. #HAPTER THREE THE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENT T#e arrival of # second fighting-machine drove us from our #eephole into the scullery, #or we feared that fr#m hi# elevati#n the Martian might see down up#n us behind our barrier. At a later date we began to fe#l less in dang#r o# th#ir eyes, for to #n eye in th# dazzle #f th# sunlight out#ide our refuge must have been blank #lackness, but at first #he slighte#t suggest#on #f app#oach drove us into t#e scu#lery in heart-throbbing retreat. Yet terrible #s was the danger #e incurred, the attr#ction of peeping was for both of us irresistible. And I recall now with a sort of wonder tha#, #n s#ite of the infinite danger in which #e were between starva#ion and # stil# more terrible #eath, we could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege #f sig#t. #e would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and the dread of makin# a noise, and strike each other, #nd thrust an# kick, withi# a f#w inches of exposure. T#e fact is #hat we had absolutel# inc#mpatible dispositions and habits of thought and action, and our danger an# isolation only accentuated #he incompa#ibility. #t Halliford I had already come #o hate the curate's trick of helpless exclama#ion, h#s stupid rigidity of mind. His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I made to t#ink ou# a line #f actio#, and drove me at times, thus pent #p and intensified, almost to the verge of cr#ziness. He was as lacking #n restraint as a sil#y woman. #e would weep for hours #ogether, and I verily believe that to #he v#ry end this spoiled child of li#e thought his #eak t#ars i# some way efficacious. And I would sit in th# darkness un#ble to keep my mind o#f him #y reason #f hi# importunities. H# ate more th#n I did, a#d it #as in vain I poi#ted ou# that #ur only chance of life was to sto# in the house un#il the Martians had done wi#h their pit, th#t in that lo#g patience # time might presently come when we shou#d need food. #e ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals #t long intervals. #e slept l#ttle. As the days wore #n, hi# utter carelessnes# of any consideration so intensifi#d our distr#ss and danger that I h#d, much as # loathed doing it, to resor# to threats, and at last to blows. That br#ught h#m to reaso# for a t#me. But he was one of those weak creatures, void of pride, timorous, anae#ic, hat#ful so#ls, ful# of shifty cunning, who #ace neither God nor man, who fac# not even themselves. It is disagreeable for #e to recall and write these th#ngs, but I set them down that my story may l#ck noth#ng. Th#se wh# #ave escaped th# dark a#d terrible aspects of life wi#l #ind my brutality, #y flash of r#ge in our final tragedy, easy enough t# blame; for they know what is wrong as well #s any, but not what is possible t# t#rtured men. But those who #ave been under the #hadow, who have g#ne down a# last #o elemental things, will have a wider c#arity. And while w#thin we fought out our dark, dim cont#st of whispers, snatched food and drink, and grip#ing #ands and blows, without, in th# pitil#ss sunlight of that terrible June, was the strange w#nder, the unfamiliar routine of th# Martians #n the pit. Let me return to tho#e first ne# experiences of mine. After # #ong tim# I ventured back to the peephole, to find that t#e new-comers had been reinforced by the occupants of no fewer th#n three of t#e fighting-mach#nes. #hese las# had brou#ht with t#em certain fresh applian#es that #tood in an orderly manner about #he #ylinder. The seco#d handling-machine was now completed, an# was busied i# servi#g o#e of th# novel #ontrivances the big machine ha# brought. This was a body resembling a milk can in its general form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, and from which # stream #f white powder flowed into a c#rcular basin below. The oscillatory moti#n #as imparted to this by one tentacle of #he handling-machine. With two spatulate #ands t#e handling-machine #as digging out and flinging masses of c#ay into the pear-shaped receptacle #bove, while with another #rm it periodically opened a door and removed r#sty an# blackened clinkers from t#e middle part of the machine. Anoth#r ste#ly tentacle directed the p#wder from the basin along a ribbed chan#el towards some receiver that was hidden fro# #e by the mound of bluish du#t. From this unseen receiver a little thread #f g#een smoke rose vertically i#to the quiet air. As I l#oked, the handling-machine, with a f#int and mus#cal clinking, extended, telescop#c f#shion, a tentacle that had been a m#ment before a mere blunt projection, until its end was hidde# #ehind the #ound of clay. In another second it h#d #ifted # bar of white aluminium into sight, untarnished as yet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited it in a growing st#ck o# bars that stood at the side of the pit. Between sunset and starlight this dexterous machine must have made m#re tha# a hundred suc# bars o#t of the crude clay, and the mou#d o# bluish dust ro#e steadily until it topped the side of the pit. The contrast between th# swift and complex movements of th#se contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters w#s acut#, and for days I had to t#ll myself repeatedly that these latter were indeed the living o# the tw# things. The cur#te had possession of the slit when #he fir#t men were broug#t to #he pi#. I was sitting below, huddled up, lis#ening with all my ears. He made a sudden movement backwa#d, and I, fearful that we were observed, crouched in a spasm of terror. He came sliding down the rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate, gesticulating, a#d for # mome#t I sha#ed his panic. H#s gesture su#gested a resignation of the slit, #nd after a little while my curiosity gave me co#rage, and I rose up, stepped across #im, and clambered #p to it. At first # could see #o reaso# for his frantic behaviour. The #wilight had #ow come, the stars were little and faint, but the pit was illuminated #y t#e flickering gre#n fire that came from the aluminium-making. The whole picture was a fli#kering scheme of green gleams and shifting rus#y black sha#ows, strangely t#ying to the eyes. Over and through i# all went the ba#s, heeding it not at #ll. The sprawling Martians were n# longer to #e seen, th# mound of blue-#reen powder h#d risen #o c#ver them from s#ght, and a fighting-machine, with its legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated, stoo# across the corner of the pit. #nd then, amid the clangour o# th# machinery, came a drifti#g suspicion #f human voices, that I entertained a# first only t# dismiss. I crouched, watching thi# fighting-ma#hine closely, sat#sfying myself #ow for the first time that th# hood did indeed contain a Ma#tian. As #he green f#ames lifted I could see th# oily gle#m #f his integ#ment an# the brightness of his eyes. An# #uddenly I heard a y#ll, and #aw a long tentacle reachin# over the shoulde# of the machine #o the little cage that hunched upon it# ba#k. Then something--something struggling v#olently--was lifted high against the sky, a black, vague enigma against the starligh#; and as this black obje#t #ame down again, I saw by the green brightness that it was a man. For an #nstant #e was clearly visible. He wa# a stout, ruddy, middle-aged man, well dressed; three days before, he must have bee# walki#g the world, a man of considera#le consequence. I coul# see his staring eyes and gleams of light o# h#s studs and wa#ch chai#. He vanished behind the mound, and for a moment there #as silence. A#d t#en began a shriek#ng #nd a sustained and cheerful hooting from the Martians. I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my hands over my ears, and bolted into the scullery. The curate, #ho had #een cr#uching silently with hi# arms over his head, looked u# as I pa#sed, #ried out #uite loudly at my de#ertion of him, and came running after m#. #hat night, as #e lurked i# the s#ullery, balance# between o#r horror and the #errible fascination this peepin# had, although I felt an urgen# need of acti#n # tried in vain to conceive some plan of escape; b#t afterwards, during the second day, I was abl# to consider our position with great clearness. The curate, I found, was qu#te incapable of discussion; this ne# and culminating atrocity h#d robbed him of all #estiges of reason or foretho#ght. Practically he h#d already sunk to the level #f an anim#l. But #s th# saying goes, # gripped myself with #oth hands. It grew upon my mind, once I could face #he f#cts, t#at te#rible a# o#r position was, there was as yet n# justification for absolute despair. Our chie# chance lay in the possibility of the #artians making the pit not#ing more than # temporary enc#mpment. #r even if they kept it permanently, t#ey migh# not consider it necessary #o guar# it, and a chance of escape might be afforded us. # als# weighed very care#ully t#e possibility of our digging a way out i# a dir#ction a#ay from the pi#, but the chances #f our emerging within sight of #ome senti#el fighting-machine seemed at first to# great. And I sho#ld #ave had to do all the digg#ng myself. The curate would certainly h#ve fai#ed m#. It was on the third day, if my me#ory serves me right, that I #aw t#e lad killed. It was the only occ#sion on which # actually sa# the Martians feed. After that e#perience I avoided the hole #n t#e wall for the better part #f a day. I went into the scullery, removed t#e door, and spent #ome #ours digg#ng with my hatchet a# si#ently as poss#ble; but when I #ad made a hole about a couple of feet d#ep the loose earth collap#ed noisily, a#d I did not dare continue. I lost he#rt, #nd lay dow# on the sculler# floor for # long t#me, having no spirit even to move. And af#er that I abandoned altogether the idea of escaping by excavation. #t s#ys much for the impressio# the Martians #ad ma#e up#n me that at f#rst I entertained little or no #ope o# our escape being brought about by thei# overthrow through any human effort. #ut o# t#e fourth or fi#th night I he#rd a sound like heavy guns. It was very la#e in the night, an# the moon w#s shini#g brightly. T#e Martians #ad taken away the excavating-machine, and, #ave for a fighting-machine t#at s#ood i# the remoter bank o# th# pit and a h#ndling-machine that wa# buried out of m# sight #n a corner of t#e pit immediatel# beneath my peephole, the place was deserted by them. E#cept for the pale glow from t#e handling-machine and the bars and patches of white m#onlight #he pit was in darkne#s, an#, except for the clinking #f the handling-machine, quite st#ll. That night was # beauti#ul serenity; save for one pla#et, the moon seem#d to have #he sky to herself. # heard a dog ho#ling, and that familiar #ound it was that #ade me lis#en. Then I hea#d quite distinctly a boomin# exactly like #he sou#d of great guns. Six distinct #eports # counted, and after a lon# interval six again. And that was all. CHAPTER FOUR THE #EATH OF THE CURATE It was on the sixth day of our impriso#ment that I peeped for the last tim#, and presently found myself alone. Instead of keeping close to me and trying to oust me from t#e slit, the cu#ate ha# gone back int# the scullery. I was struck by a sudden thought. I went b#ck quickly #nd quietly into the scullery. In the darkness I heard the curat# drinking. I snatched in the darkness, an# my fingers ca#ght a bottle of burgundy. For a #ew minutes there was # tussle. The b#ttle struck the floor and broke, a#d I desisted and rose. We stood panting and thr#atening each other. In the end I planted myself between him and the fo#d, and tol# him of my #etermination to begin a discipline. I divided the food in the pantry, #nto rati#ns to la#t us ten days. I would not let hi# #at any more that day. In the afternoon he made # feeble effort to get #t the food. I had bee# dozing, #ut in an instant I was awake. All day and all #ight we sat face to fa#e, I weary but resolute, and he weeping and complaining of hi# immediat# hunger. It was, # know, a n#ght an# a da#, but to me it seemed--it see#s #ow--an interminable length of time. And so #ur widened incompatibility ended at last in open confli#t. For tw# vast days #e struggled i# undertones and wrestling contests. There were times when I beat and kicked him madly, times when I caj#led #nd persuaded him, a#d #nce I tried to bribe him with the last bottle of burgundy, for there was a rain-water pump from which I could g#t #ater. But neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed beyond reason. He would n#ither d#sist fr#m his a#tacks on t#e food nor from his noisy babbling to himself. #he rudimentary precautions to keep our imprisonment endurable he #ould no# observe. Slowly I began to realise the complete overthrow of his intelligence, to perceive that m# sole companion in t#is clos# and sickly darkness was a ma# insane. From certain vague memories # am inclined to #hink my own mind wander#d at times. I had strange an# hideous dr#ams whenever I slept. It soun#s paradoxical, but I am inclined t# t#ink that the weakness an# insanity o# the c#rate #arned me, braced me, and kept me a sane man. On the eighth d#y he began to talk al#ud instead of whisper#ng, and not#ing I could do wo#ld moderate his speech. "It is #ust, O G#d!" he would s#y, over and over again. "It is just. On me and mine be the punishment laid. We h#ve sinned, we have fallen short. There #as poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust, and # held #y pea#e. I preached acceptable folly--my God, what folly!--when I shoul# have sto#d u#, thou#h # died for it, and called upon th#m to repent--repent! ... Oppressors of the #oor and #eedy...! The wine press of God!" Then #e would suddenly revert #o the matter #f the food # withhe#d from him, #raying, begging, weeping, at last threateni#g. He began to rai#e #is voice--I prayed him not to. #e perce#ved # hold on me--he threatened h# would shou# and bring the Martians upon us. For a time that scared me; but any concession wo#ld have shortened our chance of escape beyond es#imating. I defied him, although I felt no a#surance that he migh# #ot do this thing. But that day, #t any rate, h# did not. He talked with his voice risi#g slowly, through #he greater #art o# the eighth #nd ninth days--threats, entreaties, mingled with a torr#nt of half-sane and always fr#thy repentance f#r hi# vacant sh#m of God's service, su#h as mad# me pity him. Then #e #lept awhile, a#d began again w#th rene#ed strength, so loudl# th#t I #ust needs mak# #im desist. "Be still!" # implored. He rose #o hi# knees, for he had been sitting in the darkness ne#r the copper. "I hav# been still too #ong," he said, in a tone that must have reach#d the pit, "and n#w I must bear my witness. Woe unto this unfaithful c#ty! Woe! Woe! Woe! W#e! Woe! To th# inhabitants #f the ear#h #y reason of the other voices of the trumpet----" "Shut up!" # sai#, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest t#e Martians should hear u#. "For God's sake----" "N#y," shouted the curate, at the t#p of his voice, standing likew#se and extending h#s arms. "Speak! The word of #he Lord #s upon me!" In #hree strides he was at the door leading int# the kitchen. "I must bear my witness! I go! I# has already be#n too l#ng delayed." I put out my han# and felt th# m#at chopper hanging to the wall. In a flas# I was after him. I was fie#ce with fear. Before he was halfway across the kitchen I had overt#ken him. With one last touch of humanity I turned the blade #ack and s#ruck him with the #utt. He went headlong forward and lay stretched o# #he ground. # stumb#ed over him and stood panting. H# lay still. Suddenly I heard a noise without, the #un and s#ash of slipp#ng #laster, and the triangula# aperture in the wal# wa# darkened. I looked up and saw th# lower surface of a handling-machine coming s#owly across the hole. #ne of #ts grippin# limbs cu#led amid the debris; another limb ap#eared, feeling its way over the fallen b#ams. # stood petrified, staring. Then I saw through # sort of glass plate near the edge of the #ody the #ace, as we may call it, #nd the large dark eye# of a Martian, peer#ng, and then a l#ng metallic snake of tentacle came feeling slowl# through the hole. I turned by #n effor#, stumbled over the #urate, and stopped at the scullery doo#. The tentacle wa# now some way, two yards or more, #n the room, a#d twisting an# turning, w#th queer sudden mov#ments, this w#y #nd that. For a while # stood fascinated by that slow, fitful advance. Then, with a fain#, hoarse cry, I forced myself across the scullery. I trembled violently; I could scarcely stan# upright. I opened the doo# of the coa# cellar, and stood #here in the #arkness staring at the faintl# lit doorway into the kitc#en, and listen#ng. #ad #he #artian se#n me? What was it doing now? Something wa# moving t# a#d fro there, very quietly; every now and then i# tapped #gainst the wall, o# started on #ts movements with # faint metallic ringing, like the #ovements of keys on # split-ring. Th#n # heavy body--I knew too well what--was dragged acr#ss the #loor of the kitchen towards the opening. Irresistibly attracted, # crept to the door and pe#ped into the kitchen. I# the tria#gle of bright outer sunlight I saw th# Martian, in its Briareus of a handling-machine, #crutinizing the curate'# head. I thought a# once that it #ould infer my presence from t#e mark of the blow I h#d given him. I c#ept bac# to the coal c#llar, shut the #oor, and began to #over #yself up as m#ch as # co#ld, and as noiselessl# as possible i# the darkn#ss, among the firewood and coal ther#in. Eve#y now a#d then # paused, rigid, to hear i# the Martian #ad th#ust its tentacles through #he opening again. Then the #aint metallic jingle returned. I traced it slowly feeling ove# the kitche#. Presently # he#rd it nearer--in th# scullery, #s I judged. I thought that #ts length might be insufficient to reach me. I prayed copiously. It passed, scraping faintly across the cellar door. An age of almo#t intolerable suspense intervened; then # #eard it fumbling at the latch! #t had found the door! T#e M#rtians understood doo#s! It worried at th# catch for a minute, per#aps, and then the door opened. I# the darkness I could just see #he thing--like a# elephant's trunk more than anything else--#aving t#wards me an# touching a#d examining the wall, #oals, woo# and ceiling. It was like a black wor# swaying its #lind h#ad to an# fro. Once, #ven, it touched t#e heel of my boot. I was on the verge of scream#ng; I bit my h#nd. For a time the tentacle was silent. I could have fancied it had been withdrawn. Presently, with an abrupt cl#ck, it gripped something--I thought it had me!--and seemed to go out of the #ellar agai#. For a m#nute I w#s not sure. Apparently it ha# taken a lump of c#al to examine. I seized the opportunity of slightly shifting m# position, #hich had become cramped, and then listened. I whispered passionate prayers for safety. Then # heard the sl#w, deliberate sound creeping towar#s me again. Slowly, slowly it drew near, scratchi#g agains# #he walls and tapping the furniture. While I was s#ill dou#tful, it rapped smartly against the cellar door and #losed it. I heard it go into the pan#ry, and the biscuit-tins rattled and a bottle smashed, and then came a heavy bump against the cellar door. Then silence that passed into #n infinity of suspense. Had i# gone? At last I decided that it had. It came #nto th# scullery n# more; but I lay all the tenth day in the close darknes#, burie# amo#g coals and fi#ewood, not daring ev#n to cra#l #ut for the d#ink fo# which I craved. It was the #leventh day before I ven#ured s# far from my security. CHAPTER FIVE T#E STILLNESS My first act before I went into the pa#try #as to fasten the door between the kitchen and th# scullery. #ut #he p#ntry wa# empty; e#ery scrap o# food had gone. Apparently, the Martian had take# #t all on th# previous day. At that discovery I despaired fo# the firs# time. I t#ok n# food, o# #o drin# either, on the eleventh or the twelfth da#. At first my mouth and thro#t were parched, an# my #trength ebbed sensib#y. # sat about in th# darkness of th# scullery, in # state of despondent wretchedness. My #ind ran on eating. I tho#ght I had #ecome d#af, for the noises of movement I had bee# accustomed to hea# from t#e pit ha# ceased absolutely. I did not #eel strong enough to crawl noiselessly to the peephole, or # would h#ve gone there. On th# twelfth day my throat was so painful that, taking the chance of al#rming the Martians, # attacked the creaking rain-water pump that stood b# th# sink, and #ot a couple #f glassfuls of blackened and tainted rain #ater. I was greatly refreshed by this, and emboldened #y the fact #hat #o enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my pumping. #uring these days, in a rambling, inconclusive way, # tho#ght muc# of the curate a#d of the manner of h#s death. On the thirteenth day # #rank som# more wa#er, and doze# an# thought disjointedl# of eating and #f va#ue impossible plans of escape. Whenever I dozed # dreamt of horrible phanta#ms, of the death of the curate, or of sumptuous dinners; but, asleep or awake, I felt # keen #ain th#t urged m# #o d#ink again and again. T#e light that cam# into the scull#ry w#s #o longer grey, #ut re#. #o my disordered imagina#ion it seemed the colo#r of blood. On the fourteenth day # went in#o the kitchen, and I wa# surprised to find that the fronds of the re# weed had grown right across the hole in #he wall, turning the half-light of th# place int# # crimson-c#loured obscurity. It was early on the fifteenth day that # heard a curious, familiar sequenc# of sounds #n th# kitchen, and, listening, identified it as the snuffi#g a#d scratching of a dog. #oing in#o the kitchen, # saw a dog's nos# peeri#g in through # break amon# the ruddy fronds. This greatly surpr#sed me. At the scent of me he barked sh#rtly. I thoug#t if # could induce him to c#me i#to the place quietly I should be able, perh#ps, to kill and eat him; and in #ny case, #t would be advisab#e to kill him, le#t his actions attr#cted the attention #f the Marti#ns. I crept forward, saying "Good dog!" very #oftly; but #e suddenly withdrew h#s head and disappeared. I l#stened--I was no# deaf--but c#rtainly the pit w#s still. I heard # sound like the flutter of a bird's wings, #nd # hoarse croak#ng, but that #as a#l. #or a long while I lay close to the peephole, but not daring to move aside #he re# plants that obscured it. Once or twice I heard a faint pitter-patter li#e the feet of the dog goin# hither and thither on th# sand far below me, and the#e w#re more birdlike sounds, but that #as all. At #ength, encouraged by the silence, I looked o#t. Except in the corn#r, where a multitude of crows hopped and fought ov#r the skeletons of the dea# #he Mart#ans had consumed, there was n#t a living thin# #n the pit. # stared about me, scarcely believing my e#es. All the machinery had gone. Sav# for the big mound of greyish-blue powder in one corner, certa#n bar# of aluminium i# another, the black birds, and the skeleto#s o# #he kill#d, th# place was me#ely an empty circular pit i# t#e sand. Slowly # thrust myself out through the #ed wee#, an# stood upo# the mound of rubble. I could see in any direction save behind me, to the nor#h, a#d neither Martians no# sign #f Martians were to be seen. The pit d#opped sheerly from my feet, but a littl# way along th# rubbish af#orded a pract#cable slope to the summit of the ruins. #y chance of escape had come. # began t# tremble. # hesitated for some t#me, and the#, in a gust of desperate resol#tion, and with # heart th#t th#obbed viol#ntly, I scrambled to the top of t#e mound in which I had b#en buried s# long. I look#d about again. To the northward, too, no Martian was visible. W#en I had last s#en this part #f Sheen in t#e daylight it ha# been a straggling street #f comfortable white and red houses, interspersed with abun#ant shady trees. Now # stood on a mound of smashed brickwork, clay, and gr#vel, over w#ich sp#ead # multitud# of red cactus-shaped plants, k#ee-high, without a solitary terrestrial #rowth to dispute their footing. T#e trees near me #ere d#ad and brown, #ut further a network of red th#ead scaled the #till living stems. #he neighbouring houses had all bee# wrecked, but #one had been burned; their walls stood, sometimes to th# second story, with smas#ed windows and shatte#ed doors. The #ed weed gr#w tumult#ously in their roofless rooms. Below me was the great pit, with the c#ows struggling for its refuse. # number #f oth#r birds hopped about among th# ruins. #ar a#ay # saw a gaunt cat #link crouchingly along a wall, but traces of men t#ere were none. The day seemed, by contrast with my recent confine#ent, dazzlingly bright, the sky a glowing bl#e. # g#ntle #reeze kept the r#d weed that covered every scrap #f unoccupied ground gently swaying. And oh! the sweetn#ss o# #he air! CHAPTER SIX THE WORK OF FIFTEE# DAY# For some time I stood tottering on the m#und rega#dless of my sa#ety. Wi#hin tha# noisome d#n from which I had emerged I had t#ought wit# a na#row intensity o#ly of our immediate security. I had not realised what had bee# happening t# the world, had not anticipated this st#rtling vision of unfamiliar things. I had expected to see Sheen #n ruins--I found abo#t #e #he l#ndscape, weird and lurid, of another pl#net. F#r that momen# I touched an emotion be#ond #he common ran#e of men, yet one that the poor brutes we dom#nate know only t#o well. I felt as a rabb#t might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly confronted by t#e work of a dozen bu#y na#vies digging the foundations of a hou#e. I felt the first inkling of a thing that presently #rew qui#e clear in my mind, that oppressed me for many days, a sense of dethronemen#, a persuasion that I #as no longer a master, but an animal among the animals, unde# the #artian heel. W#th us i# would b# as with th#m, to lurk and watch, to ru# and hide; th# fear and empire of ma# had passed away. But so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed, and my dominant motive became the hunger #f my long and dism#l fast. In the direction away from the pit I saw, beyo#d a red-cov#red wall, a patch of garden groun# unburied. #his gave #e a #int, and # went knee-deep, and sometimes neck-deep, in the #ed #eed. #he #ensity of the weed gave #e a reassuring sense of hiding. The wa#l w#s some six feet high, and when I attempted to clamber it I found # could not #ift #y feet to the crest. So I went along by the side o# it, and cam# to a corner and a rockwork tha# enabled #e to get to the top, an# tumble i#to the garde# I #oveted. Here I found some young onions, # coup#e #f gladi#lus bulbs, an# a quantity of i#mature carrots, all of which I s#cured, and, scrambling over a ruined wall, went on my way through #carlet and crimso# trees towards Kew--it was like walking throu#h an avenue o# gigantic bl#od drops--pos#essed with #wo idea#: to get #ore #ood, and to limp, as soon and as far as my strength permi#ted, out #f this accursed unearthly region of the pit. Some way farther, #n a grassy place, was # group of mushrooms which also # devoured, and #hen I came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow water, wher# meadows us#d to be. These fragments of nourishment #erved only t# whet my hunger. At first # #as surprised at thi# flood in a hot, dry sum#er, but afterwards I discovered that it #as caused by the tropical exuberance #f th# red weed. Directly this extraordinary growth encountered water #t straightway became gigantic an# of unparallel#d fecundity. Its s#eds were si#ply poured down into the water #f the W#y and T#ames, and its s#iftly growin# and Titanic water fronds speedily chok#d both those rivers. A# Putney, #s I afterward# saw, the brid#e was almost los# in a tangle of this weed, and at #ichmond, too, the Thames water poured in a broad and sh#llow stream across the meadows o# Hampton and #wickenham. As th# water spread the w#ed follo#ed them, until t#e ruined v#llas of the Thames valley were for a time l#st in this red swamp, whose margin I explored, #nd much #f #he desolation the Martians had caused was conce#led. In the end the red weed succum#ed almost as quickly as it had spr#ad. # c#nkering dise#se, due, it #s believed, to the action of certain bacteria, presently seize# #pon it. N#w by the action of na#ural sel#ction, all ter#estrial plants have acquired a res#sting power against bacteri#l diseases--they neve# succumb without a severe struggle, but the red weed rotted lik# a thing al#eady dead. #he frond# became bleached, and then shr#velled a#d brittle. The# broke off #t the least t#uch, and the waters #hat h#d stimulated th#ir earl# growth carried their la#t ves#iges out to s#a. My first act on coming to t#is water was, of course, to #lake my thirst. I drank a great deal of it and, #oved by an impulse, gnawed some fronds o# red weed; b#t they were watery, #nd had a sickly, metallic taste. I found the water was sufficiently shallow #or me #o wade securely, althou#h th# red weed impeded my fee# a little; #ut the flood evidently got deeper towa#ds the #iver, and I tur#ed #ack to Mortlake. I #anaged to make out the road by means of occasional ruins of its #illas and fences and lamps, and so presently I got out of t#is spate and ma#e my wa# to the hill going up towards Roehamp#on and came out on Putney #ommon. Here t#e scenery changed from th# strange and unfamiliar t# the wreckage #f the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devasta#ion of a cyclone, and in a few s#ore yards I would come up#n perfectly undisturbed spaces, houses #ith thei# blinds trimly #rawn and doors clo#ed, as if they had been l#ft for a day b# the owners, or as if their inhabitants slept within. T#e red we#d w#s less abundant; th# tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper. I hunted for food among t#e trees, finding nothing, and # also raided # couple of silent houses, but th#y ha# #lready bee# broken into and ransacked. I rested for the remainder of th# daylight in a shrubbery, being, #n my enfeebled condition, too fatigued to push on. All this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of the Martians. I encountere# a couple o# hungry-looking dogs, but both hurried circuitously away from the advances I made them. Near Roehampton I had seen #wo human skeletons--not bodies, but skeletons, picked clean--and i# the wood by me I fo#nd the crushed and scattered bones of several cats and rabbits and the skul# o# a sheep. But though # gnawed parts #f these in my mouth, the#e was nothing to be got from th#m. After sunset I #truggled on along the r#ad towards Putney, wher# I think the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason. And in the garden beyond Roehampto# I g#t # quantity of immature potatoes, sufficient t# stay my hunger. Fr#m th#s g#rden o#e looked down upon Putney and the river. The asp#ct o# the place in the dusk was singularly desolate: blackened #rees, blackened, desolate ruins, and #own the hill the s#eets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the weed. And over all--silence. I# fill#d me with indescribable t#rror to t#ink how swiftly th#t desol#ting change had come. For # time # believed tha# mankind had been s#ept out of existence, and tha# I stood there alone, th# last man le#t alive. Hard by the to# of Putney Hill I came upon another skeleton, with the arms dislocated and removed sev#ral yards from the rest of the body. As I proceeded I beca#e mo#e and more con#inced tha# the extermination of mankind was, save f#r such stragglers as myself, already accomplished in this part #f th# world. The Martians, I thought, had gone on and left the country desolated, seeking food el#ewhere. Perha#s even now they were destroying Berl#n or Paris, or #t mig#t be they had gone northward. C#APTER SEVEN TH# MAN ON PUTNEY #ILL I spent tha# night in the inn that stands at the to# of Putney Hill, sleeping in a made bed for #he first time since #y flig#t to Lea#herhead. # will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking into that house--afterwards # found the front door was on the latch--nor #ow # ransacked eve#y room for f#od, until j#st on the verge o# despair, in what seemed to #e #o #e a se#vant's bedroom, # found a rat-gnawed crust an# two tins of pineapple. #he place had #een alread# search#d #nd emptied. In the bar I afterwards found #ome biscuits and sandwiches that ha# be#n overlooked. The la#ter I could no# eat, they were too rotten, but #he forme# #ot only stayed my hunger, b#t fil#ed #y pockets. I lit no lamps, fearin# some Martia# #ight co#e beating that part of Lo#don for food in the night. Before I wen# to bed I ha# an interval of restlessness, and pro#led from windo# t# window, peering out f#r some sign o# these m#nsters. I slept litt#e. A# # lay in bed I found myself thinking consecutively--a thin# I do not remember to have d#ne since my last argument with #he curate. During all the int#rvening ti#e my mental condition had been a hur#ying succession of vague emotional states or a #ort o# stupid rece#tivity. But in the night my brain, reinforced, I suppose, by the foo# # had eaten, gr#w cl#ar again, an# I thought. Thre# th#ngs struggle# #or possession o# my mi#d: the killing of the curate, the whe#eabouts #f the Martians, and th# possible fate o# my wife. The forme# gave me n# sensat#on #f hor#or #r remorse to reca#l; I s#w #t simply as a thing done, a me#ory infinitely disagreeable but qu#te without th# quality of #emorse. I #aw myself #hen #s I s#e myself no#, d#iven ste# b# step towards #hat hasty blow, the creature o# a sequence of accide#ts leading inevitably to #hat. # felt no condemnation; yet the memo#y, static, unprogressive, haunted me. In the silence of #he night, with that sense o# th# nearness of #od that #ometimes comes into th# stillness and the darkness, I stood my trial, my only trial, f#r that moment of wrath and fe#r. I r#traced e#ery step of our conversation from the moment when I had found him crouching beside me, heedless of my thirst, and pointing to the fire and smoke that streamed #p from #he ruins #f Weybridge. We had been incapable of co-operation--grim chance had taken no heed of that. H#d I foreseen, # shou#d have left him a# #alliford. But I d#d n#t foresee; and cr#me i# to foresee and do. And I set this down as I have set all th#s story #own, #s #t was. There were no witnesses--#ll these things I might hav# concealed. But I set it d#wn, and th# reader m#st form his judgment #s he will. And when, #y an effort, I #ad set aside #hat picture of a prostrate bo#y, I faced the p#oblem of the Martians and the f#te of my #ife. For the former # had no data; I could imagine a hund#ed th#ngs, #nd so, un#appily, I coul# for #he latter. #nd #uddenly that night became ter#ible. I found myself sitting up in bed, staring at the da#k. # found myse#f praying tha# the Heat-Ray might have sudd#nly and painlessly struck her out o# being. Since the night of my retur# from Leatherhead I had not prayed. I had uttered prayer#, fetish prayers, had prayed as heath#ns mu#ter charms w#en # was in extremit#; but now I p#ayed #ndeed, pl#ading steadfastly and sanely, f#ce to face with the darkness of God. Str#nge night! Stran#est #n this, #hat so soon as dawn h#d com#, I, #ho #ad talked w#th God, cr#pt #ut of #he #ouse like # ra# leaving its hiding place--# creature scarcely lar#er, an inferior #nimal, a thing that fo# any passing whim of our masters might be hunted and killed. Perhaps they also prayed confiden#ly to God. Surely, if w# ha#e learned nothing else, t#is #ar has taught us pity--pity f#r those witless so#ls that #uffer our dominion. Th# mor#ing was bright and fine, and the eastern sk# glowed pink, an# was fretted with little golden cl#uds. In the roa# that r#ns from the top of Putney H#ll to W#mbledon was a number of poor vestiges of th# panic torrent that must hav# poured Londo#ward on t#e Sunday night after the fighting bega#. There was a littl# two-wheeled cart inscribed with the nam# #f Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden, #ith a smashed wh#el and #n abandoned #in trunk; there was a straw #at trampled i#to #he now hardened mud, and at t#e to# o# West Hill a lot of blood-stained glass about the overturned wat#r trough. My mo#ements we#e languid, #y pl#ns #f the vaguest. I had an idea #f going to Leatherhead, though I #new that there # had th# poorest chance of finding my wife. Certainly, unless death had overtaken them suddenly, my #ousins an# she would have fled thence; but it seemed to me # #ight find or learn there whither the Surrey people had #led. I knew I wanted to find my wife, that my #eart ached for her and th# world of m#n, but I had no clear idea #ow the fin#ing might be #one. I was a#so sharply awa#e now of my intense loneliness. From th# c#rner # went, under cover of a thicket of tr#es and #ushes, to the edge of Wimbledon Common, #tretching w#de and far. That dark expanse wa# li# in patches #y yellow gorse and broom; #here was no red weed to be seen, an# as I pr#wled, hesit#ting, on the verge of the open, the s#n rose, flooding #t all w#th li#ht #nd vitality. I came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a #wampy place among the trees. # stopped to look at them, drawing a lesson from their stout r#solve t# li#e. An# presently, turnin# suddenly, with #n odd feeling of b#ing #atched, I beheld someth#ng c#ouching amid a clump of bushes. I stood regard#ng this. # made a ste# towards it, and i# r#se up #nd became a ma# armed wit# a cutlass. # ap#roached h#m slowly. He stood silent and motionless, regarding me. As I drew nearer I perceived he w#s dress#d in #lothes a# dusty and filthy as m# own; he looked, indeed, as #hough he had been dragged through a culvert. Nearer, # disting#ished the gr#en slime of ditches mixing with the pale drab of dried clay #nd shiny, coaly patches. Hi# bla#k hair fell over his eyes, and his f#ce was dark and dirty and sunken, #o #hat at first I did not recognise him. There was a red cut across the lower part of hi# face. "Stop!" #e cried, whe# I wa# within ten yards of him, and # stopped. His voice was hoars#. "Where d# you come fro#?" he s#id. I thought, surveying him. "I come from Mortlake," I s#id. "I w#s buried ne#r the pi# the Ma#tians made #bout their cylinder. # have #orked my way out an# escaped." "There #s no fo#d ab#ut here," #e said. "This is my country. All this hill down to the river, and back to Clapham, and up to the edge of the #ommon. Ther# is only food for one. Which way are you going?" I #nswered slowly. "# don't know," I said. "I have been #uried in the #uins of a h#use thirteen or #ourteen days. I don't kno# w#at has happen#d." He looked at me doubtfully, th#n started, and looked with a changed expression. "I've no wish t# stop #bout here," said I. "I think # shall go to Leatherhead, #or my wife #as there." He shot out a poin#ing fing#r. "It is you," said he; "the man fr#m W#king. And you weren't killed at Weybridge?" # recognised him at the same moment. "You are t#e artilleryman who came into my garden." "#ood luck!" h# said. "We a#e lucky ones! Fancy you!" He put out # han#, and I took #t. "I crawled up a d#ain," he said. "But they did#'t ki#l everyone. And after #hey we#t away I got off towards Wal#on across #he fields. But---- It's not sixteen d#ys altogether--and your hair is grey." H# looked ov#r his shoulder suddenly. "On#y # rook," he said. "One gets to know that bir#s have shadows these days. This is a bit open. Let us crawl u#der those bushes and #alk." "Have y#u seen a#y Martians?" # sai#. "Si#ce I crawled out----" "#hey've gone away across London," he said. "I gues# they've got # bigge# camp there. Of a night, all over ther#, Hampstead way, the sky #s alive with #heir lights. It's like a great city, and in the glare you can just #ee them m#ving. By daylight you can't. But n#arer--I haven'# seen them--" he co#nted on his fingers "five days. Then # saw a couple across Ham#ersmith way #arrying something big. A#d the night before last"--he stopped and spoke impressively--"it was just a matter of light#, bu# it was something up in the air. I believe they've built a flying-machine, #nd are le#rning to fly." # stopp#d, on ha#ds and knees, for we had com# to the bushes. "Fly!" "Yes," he said, "fly." I went on into # #ittle b#wer, and sat do#n. "It is a#l ov#r with humanity," I said. "If they can #o t#at they wi#l sim#ly go round #he world." He nodded. "They will. But---- #t will relieve things over here a bit. And besides----" He looked at me. "Aren't yo# satisfied it is #p with hum#nity? I #m. We're down; we're beat." I stared. Strange a# it ma# seem, # had no# arrived at th#s fact--a #act perfectly obvious so soon #s he spoke. # had st#ll h#ld # #ague ho#e; r#ther, I had kept # lifelong habit of mind. #e repeated his words, "We're b#at." They carried absolute conviction. "It's all o#er," he said. "They've l#st one--just one. And they've made their footing good and cri#pled the #reatest power in the wor#d. They'v# walke# over us. #he death of that one at Weybridge w#s #n accident. And these ar# only pion#ers. Th#y kept on coming. These #reen sta#s--I've #een none these five or si# days, but I've no #oubt they're falling somewhere every night. Nothing's to be done. We're under! #e're b#at!" # #ade hi# no answer. I sat star#ng before me, trying in vai# to devise s#me countervailing thought. "Thi# isn't a war," said th# artilleryman. "#t nev#r was a war, #ny more t#an there's #ar between man #nd ants." Suddenly # reca#led th# night in the observatory. "Aft#r the tenth #hot they fired no more--at least, until the fir#t cylinder came." "How do y#u know?" #aid the artilleryman. I explained. He thought. "Something wrong with the gun," he said. "But what i# there is? They'll #et it ri#ht again. And #ven if there's a delay, how ca# it alter the e#d? It's j#st men and ants. There's th# ant# builds th#ir cities, live their lives, have wars, r#volutions, un#il the #en want them out o# the way, and then they go out of the way. T#at's wh#t we a#e now--just ant#. Only----" "Yes," I said. "We're eatable a#ts." W# #at looking at each other. "And what will the# do with us?" I said. "That's what I've been thinkin#," he said; "that's what I've been thinking. After #eybridge I went south--think#ng. # saw w#at #as up. Most of #he people we#e ha#d at it squealing #nd exciting themselves. But I'm #ot so fond of squealing. I've been in sight #f death on#e or twice; I'm not an ornamental soldier, and at the best and worst, death--it's jus# death. A#d it's the man that kee#s on thinki#g comes t#rough. # saw ev#ryone tr#cking away south. Says I, 'Food won't last this way,' and I turned rig#t back. I went for the Martian# like a sparrow #oes for man. All round"--he waved a hand #o the horizon--"#hey're sta#ving in heaps, bolting, treading on each other. .. ." He saw my face, and halted awkw#rdly. "No doubt lots who had money ha#e gone away #o France," he said. #e seemed t# hesitate whether to apologise, met my eyes, a#d #ent on: "There's food al# about here. Canned things in shops; wines, #pirits, mineral waters; and the water mains and dra#ns are empty. Well, I was telling y#u what I w#s thinking. 'Here's intelligent things,' I said, 'and it s#ems they want us for food. First, they'll smash u# up--ships, machines, guns, c#ties, all #he order and organisation. Al# tha# will go. If we were the size of ants #e might #ull through. Bu# we're no#. I#'s all too bulky t# stop. Th#t's the fi#st certainty.' Eh?" I assented. "It is; I'v# thought it #ut. Very well, then--next; a# pres#nt we're caught as we're wanted. A Martian has only to go a few mil#s to get a c#owd on #he run. And I s#w one, one day, out by Wa#dsworth, picking houses t# pieces and routing among #he wreckage. But t#ey won't kee# on doing that. So soon #s they've settle# all our guns an# ships, and smashed ou# railways, #nd #one all the thi#gs th#y are do#ng over there, they will begin catchin# us systematic, picking #he best a#d stor#ng us i# cage# and things. That's what they wi#l start doing i# # bit. Lord! They haven't begun on us yet. Don't y#u s#e that?" "Not begun!" # e#claimed. "No# begun. A#l that's #appened so far is throug# our not having the sen#e to keep quiet--worrying them with guns and such foolery. And losing our #eads, and rushing off in crowds to where there wasn't any more safety t#an w#ere we were. They don't want to bother us yet. They're making their th#ngs--making all th# things they couldn't bring with th#m, getting things rea#y for the rest of their people. Very likely that's why the cylinders have stopped for a b#t, f#r fear of #itting those wh# are here. And instead of our rushing about blind, #n the howl, or getting dynamite on the chance of busting t#em up, we've got to f#x ourselves up according to the new state of affairs. T#at's how I fig#re it out. It isn't quite according t# w#at a man wants for his specie#, #ut it's about w#at the facts point to. And that's the principle I a#ted upon. Cities, nations, civil#sation, prog#ess--it's all over. That game's up. We're beat." "But if that #s so, what is there t# l#ve fo#?" The artilleryman looked at me for a moment. "There won't be any m#re blessed concerts for a million y#ars #r so; the#e won't be #ny Royal Academy #f Arts, and no nice little feeds at restaurants. If it's amusement y#u're after, I reckon the game is #p. If you've got any drawing-room mann#rs or # dislike t# e#ting peas wit# a knife or dro#ping aitches, you'd b#tter chuck 'em away. T#ey ain't no further use." "Y#u mea#----" "I mean #hat m#n like me a#e going on li#ing--for the sake of the breed. I tell you, I'm gr#m set #n living. A#d i# I'm not m#staken, y#u'll show what insides you've got, too, before long. We aren't going t# b# e#terminated. And # don't m#an to be caught either, #nd tamed #nd fat#ened an# bre# like a thundering ox. Ugh! Fancy those #rown creepers!" "You do#'t mean to say----" "I do. I'm going on, under their feet. I've got i# planned; I've t#ought it out. We men ar# beat. We don't know enough. We've got to lea#n bef#re we've go# a chance. And we've got to live and keep independent while we learn. See! That's what has to be done." I stare#, astonished, a#d stirred pr#foundly by the man's resolution. "Great God!" cr#ed I. "#ut you are a man indeed!" And suddenly I grip#ed hi# hand. "Eh!" he said, with his eyes shining. "I've t#ought i# out, eh?" "#o on," I sai#. "We#l, those who mean to escape the#r catching mus# get ready. I'm g#tting ready. Mind you, #t #sn't all of u# that are made #or wild beasts; and that'# what it's got #o be. #hat's why # watched #ou. I had my doubts. You're slender. I didn't kno# that it was you, y#u see, or just how you'd been #uried. #ll th#se--the sort o# people that lived i# these houses, and all tho#e d#mn little clerks that used to live down #hat way--they'd be no good. The# haven't any spirit in them--no proud dreams and no proud lusts; and a ma# who hasn't one or the other--Lord! Wha# is he but funk and precautions? They just #sed to skedaddl# off to work--I've seen #undreds of 'em, bit o# breakfast in hand, running wild and shini#g to ca#ch their little season-ticket train, f#r fe#r they'd get dismiss#d i# they didn't; working at businesses the# were afraid to tak# #he trouble to understand; skedaddling back for fear they woul#n't be in time #or #inner; keeping indoors after dinner fo# fe#r of th# back streets, and sleeping with the wives they married, not because they wante# them, #ut because th#y had # bit of money that would ma#e for safety in #heir one little miserable skedaddle through the world. Li#es insured an# # #it invested for fear of acciden#s. And on Sundays--fear #f t#e hereafter. #s if hell was built for rabbits! Well, the Martians will just be a godsend to thes#. Nice roomy cages, fattening food, #areful breeding, no worry. Afte# a #eek #r so chasing about the fields #nd lands o# empty stomachs, they'll come #nd be caugh# cheerful. #hey'll #e quite gl#d after a bit. The#'ll wonder wha# people did before there were Martians t# t#ke care of them. And the bar loafers, and mashers, and singers--I #an imagine them. I ca# imagin# them," #e said, wi#h a sort of sombre gratification. "There'll be any amount of sentiment and religion loose among them. There's hundreds of things # saw w#th m# eye# that I've only begun #o see clearl# these last fe# da#s. There's lots will tak# things a# they are--fat and stupid; and lot# will be worried by a sort of feeling that it's al# wrong, and that #hey ought #o be doing something. Now whenever things a#e so that a l#t of people fe#l they ought to be doing something, the we#k, #nd those who go we#k with a lot of com#licated thinking, always make for a sort of do-nothing r#ligion, very #ious and superior, a#d sub#it #o persecution and the will of the Lord. Very likely you've s#en t#e #ame thing. It's energy #n a gale of fu#k, and turned clean inside o#t. These cages will be full of psalm# and hymns and piety. And those of a le#s simple sort will work in a bi# o#--what is it?--eroticism." H# paused. "Ver# likel# these M#rtians wi#l make pets of some of them; train them to #o tricks--who knows?--ge# sentimental over the pet boy wh# grew up and ha# to be killed. And some, maybe, they will train to hunt us." "No," # cried, "that's impossible! No #uman being----" "What's the good of #oing on with such li#s?" said the artilleryman. "T#ere's men who'd do it cheerful. W#at nonsense to pretend #here isn't!" And I succumb#d t# #is conviction. "If they com# after me," he said; "Lord, i# they come #fter me!" and subsided into a gri# meditation. # sat contemplating these things. I could find noth#ng t# b#ing against this man's reasoning. In the #ays befo#e #he invasion no one would have questioned m# intellectual superiority #o his--I, a professed and recognised writer #n phil#sophical them#s, #nd he, a common #oldier; and y#t h# had already fo#mulated a situation that I had scarcely realised. "What are y#u doing?" I said prese#tly. "W#at plans have y#u made?" #e hesitated. "Well, it's like #his," he #aid. "What have we to #o? We have to invent a sort o# lif# where m#n can live and b#eed, #nd b# sufficiently secure to bring th# children up. Yes--wait a bit, and #'ll make #t clearer what I think ought to be done. The ta#e ones will go lik# a#l ta#e beasts; #n a few generations they'll b# big, beau#iful, rich-blooded, stupid--rubbish! Th# risk is #hat we who ke#p wild #ill go savage--degenerate into a s#rt of big, savage rat... You see, how I mean to live is underground. I'v# been thinkin# abo#t the drains. Of course those who don't know drains think horrible things; b#t under this London are miles and miles--hundreds of miles--and # few days rai# an# #ondon empty will leave them sweet and clean. #he main dra#ns are big enough and airy enough f#r an#one. Then there's ce#lars, vaults, stores, from which bolting passages #ay #e made to the drains. And #he rail#ay tunnels and subway#. Eh? You begin to see? And we form # band--able-bodied, clean-minded men. We're not going to pick up a#y rubbish that drifts in. Weaklings go out aga#n." "As you mea#t me to go?" "Well--I parleyed, didn't I?" "We won't quarrel about that. G# #n." "Those who stop obey orde#s. Able-bodied, clean-min#ed women we want #lso--mothers and teachers. No lackadaisical ladies--no blasted rolling eyes. W# can't have any weak or sil#y. Life i# rea# again, and the useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to #ie. They ought to die. They ought to be willing t# die. It's a sort #f disloyalty, after all, t# live and taint the race. And they can'# be happy. Moreover, dying's none so dreadful; it's th# funking makes it bad. And in all #hose places we shall gather. Our district will #e London. And we ma# even be ab#e to keep a wa#ch, and run about in th# open when the Martians keep away. Play cricket, perhaps. That's h#w we shall #ave #he race. Eh? #t's a possibl# #hing? But saving #he race i# nothing in itself. As # say, that's only being rats. It's saving our knowledge #nd adding to it is the thing. Ther# men like you come in. The#e's books, th#re's models. We must make great safe places down deep, #nd get all the books we #an; no# novels and poetry swi#es, but ide#s, scienc# books. T#at's whe#e men like you come #n. We must go to the British #useum and pi#k al# those books through. Especially we must keep #p our scien#e--learn #ore. We must watch the#e Martians. Some of us must g# a# spies. When it's #ll wo#king, #erhaps # will. Get caught, I mean. An# the great thing #s, we m#st leave th# Martians alone. #e mustn'# even steal. I# we get in thei# way, we clear out. W# must sho# them we me#n no harm. Yes, I know. But they're intelligent things, and th#y won't hu#t u# down i# they have all they #ant, and thi#k we're just harmless vermin." Th# artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon #y a#m. "After all, #t may not be so muc# we may have to learn b#fore--Just imagine this: fo#r or five of their #ighting machines suddenly starting off--Heat-Rays right and left, and not # Martian in 'em. Not a Martian in 'em, but men--men who h#ve learned #he way how. It may be in m# time, even--those m#n. Fancy ha#ing one #f t#em lovely things, with its Heat-Ray wide and free! Fancy having it in control! W#at would it matter #f you smashe# to smithereens at the en# of the ru#, afte# a bust lik# that? I reckon the Martians'll #pen their beautiful eyes! Can'# you see them, m#n? Can't you see them hurrying, hurrying--puffing and blowing and hoot#ng to their other mechanical a#fairs? Something out of ge#r in every case. And swish, bang, rattle, swish! Just as they are fumbling ove# it, swish comes th# Heat-Ray, and, behold! #an has come b#ck to his own." For # while t#e imaginative daring of #he a#tilleryman, an# #he to#e of assurance and courage h# assumed, completely dominated my mind. I beli#ved unhesitatingl# both in hi# for#cast of #uman #estiny and i# the practicability of his astonishing s#heme, and the reader who thinks m# suscep#ible #nd foolish must contr#st hi# position, reading #teadily with all his thoughts a#out his subject, and mine, crouching fearf#lly in the bushes and listening, distracted by apprehension. We talked in this mann#r thr#ugh t#e early morning time, and later crep# ou# #f t#e bu#hes, and, after scanning the sky for Ma#tians, hurried precipita#ely to the house on Putney Hil# where he had made his lair. It was the c#al cellar o# the place, and when I saw the work he #ad spe#t a wee# upon--it was a burro# scarcely ten #ards long, which h# designed to r#ach #o t#e main drain on Pu#ney Hill--I had my first inkling of the gulf between h#s dreams an# his powers. Su#h a hole I could have dug #n a day. But I believed #n h#m sufficiently to wor# with him all that morning until past #idday at his digg#ng. #e had a garden ba#row #nd shot the earth we removed against th# ki#chen range. W# refreshed ourselves wit# a tin of mock-turtle soup and wine fr#m the neig#bouring pantry. # #ound # curious relief from th# a#hing strangeness o# the worl# i# this #teady labour. As we worked, I turned his proje#t over #n my mind, an# presentl# objections and doubts bega# t# arise; but # worked th#re al# the mornin#, so #lad was # t# find myself wit# a purp#se ag#in. After wo#king an hour I began to spe#ulate #n the distance one had to g# before the cloaca w#s reached, the chances we h#d of miss#ng it altogether. My immediate #rouble was why #e should dig this l#ng tunnel, whe# it was possib#e to #et into the drai# at once down one #f the manholes, and work back to the house. I# #eemed to #e, too, that #he house was inconveniently chosen, and required a needless length o# tunnel. And just as I #as beginning to face these things, the artilleryman stopped digging, #nd looked at me. "We're working well," he sai#. He put down h#s sp#de. "L#t us #nock o#f # bit" he said. "I th#nk it's time we reconnoitred fr#m the roof of the house." I w#s for going on, and after # little hesitation he resumed his spade; #nd then suddenly I was struck by a thought. # sto#ped, and #o did he #t once. "Why were you walking about #he co#mon," # said, "instead o# being here?" "Taking the a#r," h# said. "I was comi#g back. It's safer by nigh#." "B#t the work?" "Oh, #ne #an't always work," he said, #nd in # flash I saw the man plain. #e hesitated, holdi#g h#s spade. "We oug#t #o reconnoitre now," #e sa#d, "because if any come #ear they may hear th# spades and drop #pon us unawares." I was no lo#ger dispo#ed to object. We went together to the roof and stood on a ladder peeping o#t of the ro#f door. #o #artians were to be seen, and we ventured out on #he til#s, and slipp#d down under shelter of the parapet. From this position # shrubber# hid the greater portion of Putney, but we could see the river below, # bubbly ma#s o# red weed, an# the low parts of Lambeth flooded and r#d. The re# creeper swarmed #p the trees about the old palace, and their b#anches stretched gaunt and dead, and set with shrivelled lea#es, from amid its clusters. It #as strange #ow entirely dependent #oth these things were u#on flowi#g water for thei# propagation. A#out us neither #ad gaine# a f#oting; laburnums, #ink mays, snowballs, and trees o# arbor-vitae, ro#e out o# laurels and hydrangeas, green and brilliant into the sunlight. #eyond #ensington de#se smoke was rising, and that and a blue haze hid the n#rthward hills. #he artilleryman began to tell me of the sor# of people #ho still remained i# Londo#. "O#e night las# week," he said, "some fools #ot the #lectric light in order, and there was all Regent Street and the Circus ablaze, crowded with pa#nted and ragged drunkards, me# a#d women, dancing and sh#uting till dawn. # man #ho was #here t#ld me. And #s the day came th#y became aware of a f#ghting-machine standing nea# #y the Langham and looking down at them. Heaven knows ho# lo#g #e had been there. It must have g#ven some of them # na#ty tur#. He came down #he road towards the#, and picked up nearly a hundr#d too drunk or frightened to #un away." Grotesque gleam of a time no history will ev#r fully describe! From t#at, in a#swer to my questions, he came round to his grandiose plans again. He grew enthusiastic. He ta#ked s# eloquently of t#e possibility of capturin# # fighting-machine that I m#re than hal# believed #n him again. But now that # was beg#nning to understand something of his quality, # could divine #he stress h# laid o# doing nothing precipitately. And I no#ed that n#w there was no question tha# he personally was to capture and fight the gr#at machine. After a tim# we we#t dow# to the cellar. N#ither of us seemed disposed #o resume digging, and when he suggested a meal, I was nothing loath. He became suddenly very generous, #nd when we had eaten he went away an# returned with s#me excellent cigars. We lit these, a#d his optimism glowed. He was incl#ned to regard m# coming as a grea# occasion. "There's some champagne in the cellar," he said. "We can dig better on this Thames-side burgundy," said I. "No," said he; "I am host today. Champagne! Great God! We've a he#vy eno#gh task before us! Let us #ake a rest and gather strength while we may. Look at these blistered hands!" And pursuant to this idea of a holiday, h# insisted u#on playi#g cards after we had e#ten. H# taugh# #e euchre, and a#ter dividing London between us, I taking the northern #ide and he t#e southern, #e played for pari#h point#. Grotesque and foolish as this #ill seem to the sober reader, #t is absolutel# true, and what is more remarkable, # found the card game an# several #thers we played extremely interesting. Str#nge min# of m#n! that, wit# our spec#es upon the edge #f e#termination #r appalling degradation, with no clear pros#ect before u# but t#e chance of # hor#ible death, we cou#d sit following the #hance of this painted pasteboard, an# playing th# "joker" with viv#d delight. Afterwards he ta#ght me poker, an# I beat him a# three tough chess g#mes. #hen dark cam# we deci#ed to t#ke the risk, and lit a la#p. After an interminable string #f games, #e #upped, and the artilleryman finished the champagne. We went on smoking the cigars. He was no longer t#e energetic regenerator o# his species I had encountered in #he morning. He was still optimist#c, b#t #t w#s # less kineti#, a more thoughtful optimism. I remember he wound up wi#h my health, proposed in a spee#h of small variety a#d considerable intermittence. I took a cigar, and #ent upstairs to look at #he l#ghts of which he had sp#ken th#t blazed so greenly al#ng the H#ghgate hills. At first I star#d unintelligently across the London valley. The northern hills were shrouded in darkness; th# fires #ear Kensington #lowed redly, and n#w and th#n a# orange-red tongue of flame f#ashed up and vanished in the deep blu# n#ght. All th# rest of London was black. Then, nearer, # perceived a stra#ge light, # pale, violet-purple fluorescent glow, quivering under the night br#eze. Fo# a space I could n#t u#derstand it, a#d t#en I k#ew #hat it must be the red weed from which this #aint irradiation proceeded. With that re#lisation my #ormant sense #f wonder, my sense of the prop#rtion o# things, a#oke aga#n. I glanced from that to Mars, red and clear, glowing high i# t#e west, and #hen gazed long and #arnestly at the darkness o# Hampstead #nd Highgate. I remained a very long time up#n the roof, wondering at the gr#tesque changes of the day. I recalled m# mental states from the midnight prayer t# the foolish c#rd-playing. I had a violent revuls#on of f#eling. I remember # flung away #he cigar w#th a certain wasteful symbolism. My folly #ame t# me with glaring exaggeration. I seemed a traitor to m# wife and #o my k#nd; I was filled with remorse. I resolve# to le#ve this strange undiscipline# dreamer of great #hings t# his drink and gluttony, and to #o on int# London. There, i# seemed to me, I h#d the b#st chance of learning what the Martians and my fellowmen were doing. I was still upon th# roof when th# late moon #ose. CHAPTER EIGHT DEAD LONDON After I had parted from the artilleryman, I went down the hill, and #y the High Street across the b#idge t# Fulham. Th# red wee# was tumultuou# at th#t time, #nd nearl# choked the bridge roadway; but its fronds we#e already whitened i# patches by the spreading disease that presently removed it so swiftly. At the corner of th# lane that #uns to Putney Bridge #tation # found a man #ying. He was as black as a swe#p with the black dust, alive, but hel#lessly and speechlessl# drunk. I c#uld get nothin# from him but curs#s and furious lunges at my head. # thi#k I should have stayed by him but for the b#utal expression of his face. There was black dust along the roadway #rom the bridge onwards, and it gr#w t#icker in Fulham. The st#eets were horribly quiet. I go# food--sour, hard, and mouldy, but qui#e eata#le--in # baker's shop her#. Some way towards Walham #reen t#e streets became cl#ar of powder, #nd I pass#d # whit# terrace of houses on fire; the noise o# t#e burning was an absolute relief. Going on toward# Brompton, the streets were quiet aga#n. Here I came once more upon the black p#wder in the streets and upon dea# bodies. I saw #ltogether about # dozen in the length of the Fulham Roa#. They had been #ead m#ny days, so that I hurried quickly #ast them. The #lack powder covered them over, #nd softened their outlines. One or two had been disturbed by #ogs. Where there was no blac# powder, #t was curiousl# li#e # Sunday in the City, with the closed shops, the houses #ocked up and the #linds draw#, the desert#on, and the stillness. In some places plunderers had been at wor#, but rarely at oth#r than the provision and wine shops. # je#eller's window had been bro#en open in one place, but appa#ently t#e thief h#d been disturbed, and a number #f gold chains and a w#tch lay scattered on t#e #avement. I did not trouble to #ouch them. Farther on was a tatter#d woman in a heap o# # doorstep; the hand that hu#g ove# her knee w#s gashed #nd bled down her rusty b#own dress, and a smashed magnum of cham#agne formed # pool #cross the pavement. She seemed asleep, bu# she w#s dead. Th# farther I penetrated int# London, the profounde# grew th# #tillness. Bu# it wa# not so m#ch the stillness of death--it was t#e s#illness #f suspense, of expec#ation. At any t#me #he destructio# #hat had alrea#y si#ged the northwestern borders of the metropolis, and had annihilated #aling and Kilburn, m#ght #trike among these houses and leave them smoking ruins. It was a city condemned a#d derelict... I# So#th Kensington #he streets were clear of dead and #f black powder. It was near South K#nsington tha# I first heard the howlin#. It crept almost imperceptibly upon m# senses. I# #as a sobbing alternation of two notes, "Ulla, #lla, ulla, ulla," keepin# on perpetually. When I passed streets that ran northward #t grew i# volume, and houses an# buildings seem#d to deaden #nd cut i# off again. It cam# in a full tide down Exhibition Road. I stopped, staring towards Ken#ington Gardens, wondering a# this s#range, remote wailing. I# was as #f that mighty desert of houses had found a voice #or its fear and #olitude. "Ulla, ul#a, ulla, u#la," wailed that superhu#an note--great waves of sound sw#eping dow# #he broad, sunlit roadway, between the tall buildings on each side. I turned northwards, #arvelling, towards the iron gat#s of Hyde P#rk. I had half # mind to break in#o the Natural Hist#ry Muse#m and fin# my way up t# the su#mits #f the tower#, in order to see across the park. But # decided to kee# to the ground, where quick hiding was possible, and so went #n #p the Exhibition Road. All the large mansions on each side of the #oad were empty and still, and my footsteps echoed again#t the sides o# the houses. At the top, near the park gate, # came #pon a strange sight--a bus overturned, and t#e sk#leton of a horse picked clean. I puzzled over t#is for # time, #nd then went on t# the bri#ge over the Serpentine. T#e voice gre# stronger and stronger, though I could #ee nothing above the housetops on the north sid# of the park, save a haze of smoke to the northwest. "Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla," cried t#e voi#e, coming, as it seemed to #e, from the district about Regent's Park. The desolating c#y worked u#on my mind. The #ood tha# #ad sustained me #assed. #he wailing took possessi#n of me. # found I was intensely weary, footsore, and n#w again hungry and thirst#. I# was already past noon. Why was I wand#ring alone in t#is city #f the dead? Why wa# I alone when all London was #ying i# s#ate, and in i#s black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely. My mind ran on ol# friends t#at # had forgotten f#r years. I thought of the poisons in the chemists' shops, of the liq#ors the wine merchants stored; I recalled the two sodden cre#tures of despair, who #o far as # knew, shared #he city with myself... I cam# into Oxford Str#et by the Marble #rch, and here again were black powder and several bodies, and #n e#il, ominous #mell from the gratings #f the cellars o# some of the houses. I gr#w very thirsty after the heat of my long walk. With infinite trouble I managed to break into # public-house and get food and drink. I was weary after eating, and #ent int# the parlour behind #he bar, a#d slept on a bl#ck horsehair sofa # found there. I awoke to fi#d that dismal howling still in my #ars, "Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla." It w#s now dusk, and after I ha# routed out some #iscuits and a cheese in the b#r--there was a meat safe, #ut it cont#ined nothing but maggots--I wandered #n throug# #he #ilent residential squares t# Baker Street--Portman #quare is the only o#e # can name--and s# ca#e out at last upon Regent's #ark. And as I eme#ged from the t#p of Baker Street, I #aw #ar away over the trees #n the clearnes# of the sunset the hood of #he Martian giant from which th#s howling proce#ded. # #as not terrified. I came upon him as if it were a #atter of co#rse. I watched him for some time, but he did not mov#. #e appeared to b# standing and yelli#g, for n# reason #hat I could discover. I tried to #ormulate a pla# of action. T#at perpetual sound of "Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla," confused my mind. Perh#ps I was too tired to be very fearful. Certainly I #as more curious #o know the reason of t#is monotonous crying than afr#id. I turned back away from t#e park an# struck in#o P#rk Ro#d, inten#ing to skirt the park, went a#ong u#der the shelter of th# te#races, and got a v#ew o# this stationary, howling Martian from the direction of St. John's Wood. # cou#le of h#ndred yards out #f Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus, and saw, first a dog with a piece of putrescent red meat i# his jaws coming he#dlong towards me, and then a pack o# starving mongrels #n pursuit of him. He mad# # wi#e curve #o a#oid me, a# though he fea#ed # might p#ove a fresh competito#. As the yelpin# died away down the silent road, t#e wailing sound of "Ulla, ulla, ul#a, u#la," reasserted itself. I came upon the wre#ked handling-machine hal#way to St. John's Woo# station. At first I t#ought a hous# h#d fallen across the road. #t was only as I clambered among the ruins that # saw, w#th a start, this mechan#cal Samson lying, with its #entacles ben# and smashed and twisted, among the ruins it had made. T#e fore#art was shattered. It seemed a# if it had driv#n bl#ndly straight at the house, #nd had b#en overwhelmed in its overthrow. It seemed to me then that t#is might have happened by # handling-machine escaping fro# the guidance of i#s Martian. # coul# n#t clamber among the ruins to see i#, and the twilight was no# s# far advanced that the blood with which its sea# was smeared, and the gnawed gris#le of the Martian that the dogs had left, were invisible to #e. Wondering still more at al# that I #ad seen, I pushe# on towards Primrose Hill. #ar away, through # g#p in the trees, # saw # second Martian, as motionless as the first, standing #n the park towards the Zoological Gar#ens, and silent. A little beyond #he ruins about the smashed handling-machine I ca#e up#n the re# weed agai#, and found the Regent's Canal, a spon#y ma#s of dark-red vegetation. As I crossed th# bridge, the sound of "#lla, ulla, ulla, ulla," #eased. I# #as, a# it were, cut off. Th# silenc# came like a thunderclap. #he #usky houses about #e stood faint and tal# and dim; the tr#es towards t#e pa#k were growing black. All about me the red weed clambered among t#e ruins, writhing to get above #e in t#e dimness. Night, the mother o# fear and myste#y, wa# c#ming #pon me. But while that voic# sounded the solitude, the desolation, had b#en endurab#e; by virtu# of it London had still seemed alive, an# the sen#e of life a#out m# h#d upheld me. #hen suddenly a change, the p#ssing of something--I knew not what--and then a st#llness #hat could b# felt. Nothing but this gaunt quiet. #ondon about me gazed a# #e spectral#y. The windo#s i# the white ho#ses were #ike the eye sockets of skulls. About me my imagination f#und a thousand noiseless enemies moving. Terror seized me, a ho#ror of my temerity. #n front of me the road becam# pi#chy b#ack as thoug# i# w#s tarred, and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway. # could no# bring myself to go on. I turned down St. John's Wo#d Road, #nd r#n headlong from thi# unendurable stillness towards Kilburn. I hid from the night and the silence, unti# long a#ter midnight, in # cabmen's shelter in Harrow Road. Bu# before the daw# my courage returned, and while #he stars wer# still i# the sk# I turned once more towards Regent's Park. I missed m# way among t#e st#eets, and presently saw down a long avenue, in the half-light of t#e e#rly dawn, th# cur#e of Primr#se Hill. On the summit, towering up #o the fading stars, was a third Martian, er#ct an# motionless like the others. An insane resolve possessed me. # would die and end it. And # would sav# myself even t#e trouble of killing myself. I marched on rec#lessly toward# this Titan, and then, as # drew nearer and the light grew, # saw t#at a multitud# of black bird# was circling and clustering a#out th# hood. At that #y heart gave a bound, a#d # began running along #he road. # hurrie# through the red weed that choked S#. Edmund's Terrace I waded brea#t-high across a t#rrent #f w#ter tha# was rushing down from the waterworks towar#s the Albert Road, and emerged upon the grass before the #ising #f the #un. Great m#unds had been heap#d #bout #he crest of the hill, making a #uge redoubt of it--it was the fina# and large#t pla#e the Marti#ns had made--and fro# behind these heaps there rose a thin smoke against the sky. Against the sky line an eager d#g ran and disappeared. The though# that had flashed into m# mind grew #eal, grew credible. I felt no fear, only # wil#, trembling exultation, as I ran up the hill towards the motionless monster. #ut of the h#od hung lank shreds o# brown, at whic# the hungry birds pecked and tore. In another mo#ent I had scrambled up the earthen rampar# and stood upon #ts crest, and th# interior of th# redou#t was below me. A might# space it was, wi#h gigantic machines here and there within it, #uge mounds of material and strange shelter places. And scatt#red about it, some in their overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid handling-machines, and a dozen of them s#ark #nd silent and laid in a row, were the Martians--dead!--slain by the putrefactive a#d disease bacteria against whi#h #heir s#stems were unprepared; slain as the red wee# was being slain; slain, after all man'# devices had fai#ed, #y the humbles# things tha# God, in his wisdom, #as put upo# this eart#. For so it had come #bout, #s i#deed I an# many men might have foreseen had n#t terror a#d disaster blinded o#r minds. #hese g#rms of disea#e have taken toll o# humanity #ince the beginning #f things--taken toll #f our prehuman ancestors s#nce life #egan h#re. But by virtue of this natural selection of our kin# we have developed resisting power; to n# germs do we #uccumb without a strug#le, and #o many--those that cause p#trefaction in dead matter, for instance--our living frames are #ltogether immune. But there #re #o bacteria in Mars, and directly th#se invade#s arri#ed, di#ectly they drank and fed, our microscopic allies began to work their overt#row. Already when I w#tched them they #ere irrevocably doo#ed, dyi#g an# rottin# even as they went to and fro. #t was inevitable. By the t#ll #f a billion deaths man has bough# his birthright #f the earth, and #t is his a#ainst all comers; it would still be his w#re t#e Martians ten times as might# as th#y are. Fo# neither d# men l#ve nor die in vain. Here and the#e they were scatt#red, nearly fifty altogether, in that g#eat #ulf they had made, overtaken #y # death t#at must have #eemed to them as incomprehensible as any d#ath could b#. To me also at that time #his death was inc#mprehensible. A#l I k#ew was that th#se th#ngs t#at had b#en alive a#d so terrible to men w#re d#ad. For a moment # believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been repeated, that God had repented, that the Angel of Death #ad sla#n them in the #ight. I stood staring into the pit, and my heart lightened gloriously, #ven as the ris#ng sun struck the wor#d to fire about me with hi# rays. T#e p#t was still in darkness; the mighty en#ines, #o great an# wonderful in their power and complexity, #o unearthl# in their tortuous f#rms, rose we#rd an# vague and strange out of the sh#dows t#wards the light. A multitude of dogs, I #ould hear, fought over the bodies that lay darkly in the #epth of the pit, #ar below me. Across the pit on its farthe# lip, flat and vast and strange, la# the #reat flying-mac#ine with w#ich they ha# been experimenting u#on ou# denser atmo#phere whe# de#ay and death #rrested them. Death ha# come not # #ay #oo soon. At the sound of a cawin# overhead # looked up at the hug# fighting-machine that would fight n# #ore for ever, #t th# tattered red shreds o# flesh that dripped down upon #he ove#turned seats on the summit of Primrose Hill. I turned and looked down the slope of th# hill to where, enhaloed now in birds, stood those other two Martians that I had see# overnight, just #s deat# had overtaken them. The one had di#d, ev#n as it ha# been crying to its companions; perhaps it was the la#t t# die, and #ts voice had go#e on perp#tually until the force #f its machinery was exh#usted. T#ey glittered now, harmless tripod t#wers of shining meta#, in #he brigh#ness of the rising su#. A#l about #he pit, and saved a# by a miracle from everlasting destruction, str#tched th# gr#at Mother of Cities. Those who have only seen London veile# in her so#bre ro#es of smo#e can scarcely imagin# #he na#ed clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses. Eastward, over the blackened ruins #f the Albert Ter#ace and the sp#intered spire o# th# churc#, the s#n blazed dazzling in a clear sky, #nd here and ther# some facet in t#e great wilderness of roofs caught the light and glared with a whi#e intensi#y. Northward were Kilb#rn an# Hampsted, blue a#d cro#ded with #ouses; westward the grea# city was #immed; an# southward, beyond the Martians, #he gree# #aves of Reg#nt's Park, the Langha# Hotel, the dome o# #he Albert Hall, the Imperial Inst#tute, #nd #he giant mansions of the Brompton Road came #ut #lear #nd little in the sunrise, the jagged ruins #f Westminster rising hazily beyond. F#r aw#y #nd blue w#re the Surrey hills, and the towers of the Crysta# Palace glittered like two silver rods. The #ome of S#. Paul's was dark against t#e sunrise, and in#ured, I saw for the first time, by a huge gaping cavity on its western side. #nd as I looked at #his wide ex#anse of houses an# factories and c#urches, silent and aband#ned; as # thought of t#e multitud#nous hopes and efforts, the inn#merable hosts o# lives that had gone to buil# this hu#an reef, and of the swift and ruthless destruction #hat #ad hung over it all; when I realised that the shadow had #een r#lled back, and that men might st#ll l#ve #n the streets, and this dear va#t dea# #ity of #ine be once more alive and p#werful, # felt a wave of emotion that was near #kin to tears. T#e torment was over. Even that day t#e #ealing would begin. The survivors of t#e people scatter#d over the #ountry--leaderless, lawless, foodles#, like sheep without # shepherd--the thousa#ds who had fled by sea, wo#ld begin to return; th# pulse o# life, growing stronger and stronger, would beat a#ain in the empty streets and pour across the vacant squares. Whatever destruction was done, t#e #and of #he destroyer was stay#d. All the g#unt wrecks, the blac#ened skeletons of houses that stared so dismally a# the sunlit gras# #f the hi#l, wo#ld presently be echoing with the hammers o# the restorers and ringing with the tapping of their trowels. A# the thought I exte#ded my hands towards the sky and began thanking God. I# # year, t#ought I--in # y#ar.. . With overwhelming force came the t#ought #f myself, of my wife, and the o#d lif# of hope #nd tender helpfulness that had ceased for ever. CH#PTER #INE WRECKAGE And n#w #omes the strangest thi#g i# my story. Ye#, #erhaps, i# #s not altogether strange. I remember, clearly #nd coldly and vividly, all that I did that day until the time that I s#ood weep#ng and praisi#g God u#on th# summit of Primrose Hill. And then # for#et. O# th# n#xt thr#e days I know nothin#. I have learned since that, s# far from my being the first discoverer of #he Martian overthrow, several such wande#ers as myse#f had alread# discovered this #n the previous night. #ne man--th# first--had gone to St. Martin's-le-Grand, an#, while # sheltered in the cabmen's hu#, #ad contrived to telegraph to Pari#. Thence the joyful news had flashed all over the world; # thousand cities, chilled #y ghastly a#prehensions, suddenly flashed into frantic illuminations; t#ey knew o# it in Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, at the time #hen I #tood upon the verge of the pit. Already #en, weeping with joy, as # have hear#, shouting and staying their work to shake ha#ds a#d s#out, were making up trains, even as near as Crewe, to descend upon London. The c#urch bells that had ceased a fortnight since sudden#y caught the news, until #ll England was bell-ringing. Men on cycles, lean-faced, unke#pt, scorched #long every country l#ne shouting of unho#ed deliverance, sho#ting to gaunt, staring figures of despair. And for the food! Ac#oss the Channel, a#ross the Irish Sea, #cross the Atlantic, corn, bread, a#d meat were tearing #o our relief. All th# shipping in the world seemed go#ng Londonward i# those #ays. B#t of all this I have no memory. # drifted--a demented man. I found myself in # house of kindly people, who had f#und #e on the third day wandering, weeping, and raving through the streets of St. John's Wood. T#ey have told me sinc# that # was singi#g some insane doggerel about "The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah! Th# Last Ma# Lef# Alive!" Troubled #s #hey were w#th their own affairs, these people, whose name, mu#h as I would li#e to express my gratitude to them, I may #ot even give he#e, neve#theless cumbered themselves #ith me, sheltered me, a#d protected m# from myself. Apparently they h#d learned something #f my story from me durin# the day# of #y lapse. Ve#y gently, when my mind was assured again, did they break to me what they had learne# of the fate of Leather#ead. Two days afte# I #as imprisoned it had be#n destroyed, wi#h every soul in it, #y # Martian. He h#d swept it out of existence, as #t seemed, without any provocation, as # boy mig#t crush #n ant hil#, in the mere w#ntonness of power. I was a lonely man, and they #ere very kind #o me. I was a lonely man and # sad one, and they bore with me. I remaine# wi#h the# four days after my recovery. Al# that time I felt a vague, a growing craving to look on#e more on whatever remained o# th# little li#e that seemed so happy and bright in #y pas#. It was a mere hopeless d#sire to feast upon m# misery. They dissuaded me. They di# al# they #ould to divert #e from this morbidity. But at last I could resist the impulse no longer, and, promising faithfully to return to them, and parting, as I will confess, from #hese four-day friends with tears, I we#t o#t again into the streets that ha# lately been so dark and strange and empt#. #lready they were busy with returni#g people; in places even there were sho#s open, and # sa# a drinking fountain running wa#er. # remember how mockingly bright #he da# seemed as # wen# back #n my melanchol# pilgrimage to the little ho#se a# Woki#g, how busy t#e streets and vivi# the moving life about me. So m#ny people we#e abroad everywhere, busied in a thousand activities, that it seemed incredib#e tha# any great proportion o# the populati#n could have been slain. #ut then # noticed h#w yellow #ere the skins of the people # met, how shaggy the hair o# t#e men, how large and bright the#r #yes, and th#t eve#y o#her man still wore his dirty r#gs. The#r face# seemed all with one of tw# expres#ions--a lea#ing exultation and energy or # grim resolution. Save for the expression of the faces, London seemed a city of tramps. The vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread sen# #s b# the Fren#h gov#rnment. The ribs of the few horse# showed dismally. Haggard special constables with white badge# sto#d at the corners o# #very street. I sa# little of the mischief wro#ght b# the Martians u#til I reache# Wellington Street, #nd there I saw the red weed clambering over the buttresses #f Waterloo Bridge. At the corner of the bridge, too, # saw one of the common contrasts of that grotesqu# time--a sheet #f paper flaunting against # thicket #f the red weed, transfixed by a stick that kept i# in place. It was the pla#ard of the first newspaper to resume publication--the #aily Mail. # #ought # copy for a blackened shilling I found i# my pocket. Most of it was in blank, but th# sol#tary compositor who did the thin# had amused himself by makin# a grotesque sch#me of advertisement stereo on the back page. Th# matter he prin#ed #as emot#onal; #he new# organisation #ad n#t as yet f#und its way back. I learned nothing fresh except tha# already in #ne week the examination o# the Martian mechanisms ha# yielded astonishing results. Among o#her things, the article assured me what I did not believe a# the time, that the "Secret of Flying," was d#scovered. At Waterloo I found the free trai#s that #ere taking people to t#eir home#. The first rush was already over. There were few people in the train, and I was in no mood for #asual conversation. I got a compartment to mys#lf, and s#t with folded #rms, #ooking grey#y #t the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows. And just outside the terminus the tra#n jolted over temporary rails, and on either s#de o# the #ailway the houses were blackened ru#ns. To Claph#m Junction #he face o# London was grimy with powder of the Black Smoke, #n #pite of two days of thunderstorms and rain, and at Clapham Junction the line had bee# wrecked again; #here were hundreds of out-of-work #lerks a#d sh#pmen wor#ing si#e by side with t#e c#stomary navvies, and w# w#re jolted #ver # hasty relaying. A#l down the line from there the aspect of the c#untry was gaun# #nd unfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suff#red. Walton, by virtue of it# unburned pine woods, seemed #he least hurt of any plac# along the line. #he #andle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped mass of re# weed, in appearan#e between butcher's meat a#d pickled cabbage. The Surrey pine woods #ere too dry, however, for th# festoons of the red climber. Beyond Wim#ledon, within #ight of the line, #n certain nursery grounds, were the heaped masses o# ear#h a#out the si#th cyl#nder. # number of people were standing about it, and some #appers were busy in the midst #f i#. Over it flaunted a Unio# Jack, flapping cheerfully i# the morning breeze. Th# n#rsery ground# were everywher# crimson with the weed, # wide #xpanse of livid colour cut wi#h purple shadows, and very pa#nful to the #ye. One's gaze went with #nfinite relief from the scorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground #o th# blue-green softne#s #f t#e eastward hills. The line on the London side o# Woking #tation #as still undergoing r#pair, s# I descended #t B#fleet station and took the ro#d t# Maybu#y, p#st the place where I and the artilleryman had talked t# the hussars, and on by the spot where th# Martian had appeared to me #n the thunderstorm. Here, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find, a#ong a tangle o# re# fronds, the warped and b#oken dog cart wit# th# whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed. Fo# a time I st#od regardi#g these vestiges... Then I returned through #he pine wood, neck-high with red w#ed here and there, to fi#d the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found burial, and so came home past the College Arms. A man standing at an open cottage door greeted me b# #ame as # passe#. I looked #t my hous# with # quick fla#h #f ho#e that faded immediately. #he door had been forced; it was unfast a#d was opening sl#wly as I approac#ed. It slammed again. The curtains o# my study fluttered out of the open window from which I and t#e artiller#man ha# wat#hed the dawn. No o#e had clo#ed it since. Th# smashed bushes were just as I had left them nearly four w#eks ago. I stumbl#d into the hall, and t#e house felt empty. The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloure# wh#re I had crouched, soake# to t#e skin from the thunderstorm the night o# the catastrophe. Our muddy footsteps I saw still went up th# stairs. # followed them to my s#udy, #nd found lying on my writing-table st#ll, with the selenite pap#r wei#ht upon it, the sheet of work I ha# l#ft on the afternoon of the opening #f t#e cylinder. F#r # space I stood reading over my abandoned arguments. It was # paper o# the probable developm#nt of Moral Ideas with the development of the civilising process; and the last sentence was the opening o# a prophecy: "In abou# two hundred years," I #ad wri#ten, "we may expect----" The sentence ended abruptly. I remembered #y in#bility to #ix my mind tha# mor#ing, scarcely a month gone by, and h#w I had broken off to get my Daily Chro#icle from #he newsboy. I remembered how I went down to the garden gate as he came along, and how I had listened to his odd s#ory #f "Men from Mar#." I came down and went #nto #he dining room. There were #he mutton and the b#ead, bo#h far go#e now in decay, and a #eer bottle overturned, jus# as I and the artilleryman h#d left them. #y #ome was desolate. I perceived t#e f#lly of the faint hope I had cherished so long. An# then # strange thing occurred. "It #s no use," sa#d a voice. "The ho#se is deserted. No on# has be#n here these ten days. Do #ot s#ay here to torment yourself. No one escaped but you." I wa# startled. #ad # sp#ken my thought aloud? # turned, and the French window was open behind m#. I made a step to it, an# stood looki#g out. And there, amazed and a#raid, even as # stood amazed #nd afraid, were my cousin and my w#fe--my wife whit# and tearle#s. #he gave # faint c#y. "I came," she said. "I knew--knew----" She put her hand to her throat--swayed. # #ade a step forward, and caug#t her #n my arms. CHAPTER #EN T#E EPILOGUE # cannot but regret, now that I a# concluding my story, how little # am able to contribute t# #he discussio# of t#e #any debatable questions #hich are still unsettl#d. #n one respect I sha#l certainly provoke criticism. #y particula# province is speculative phil#sophy. #y knowledge of #omparative physiology i# confi#ed to a book or two, but it seems to me that Carver's suggestions as to the reason of the ra#id death of th# Martians #s so probable as to b# reg#rded almost as a proven conclusion. I ha#e assu#ed that in th# body of my narrative. A# any rate, in #ll the bodies of the Martian# that were examined after the war, no bacteria except tho#e already known a# t#rrestrial species w#re found. That they did n#t bury any o# their dead, a#d the reckless slaughter th#y perpetrated, point also #o an #ntire ignorance of the putrefactive process. But #robable a# this seems, i# #s #y no m#ans a proven conclusion. Neither is the compositi#n o# the Bl#ck Smoke known, w#ich the Martians used with such deadly effect, and the generato# of the Heat-R#ys rema#ns a puzzle. The terrible disasters at the Ealing and South Kensi#gton laboratories have disinclined analysts for further invest#gations upon the latter. Spec#rum analysis of th# black powder points unmistakably to th# presence of an unknown element with a brilliant group #f three lines in the green, and it is possible that it combines with argon to form a compound which acts a# #nce with dea#ly effect up#n some #onstituent in #he blood. But s#ch u#proven speculations will scarcel# b# o# int#rest to t#e general reader, to whom this story #s add#essed. None of th# bro#n scum that drifted down the Thames after the destructio# of Shepperto# was #xamined a# the time, a#d now no#e is forthcoming. The #esults of a# an#tomical examination #f the Martians, so far as the prowling dogs had left such #n examination possible, I ha#e already given. But everyone is familiar wi#h #he magnific#nt and almost complete specimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum, an# the countless d#awings that have been ma#e from i#; and b#yond #hat the interest of the#r p#ysiology and structure is purely sc#entific. # question of graver and universal in#erest is the p#ssibility o# anot#er attack from the Martians. I do no# t#ink tha# nearly e#ough attention is being giv#n to this aspect #f th# matter. A# p#esent the p#anet Mars is #n conjunction, but with every return t# opposition I, for one, anticipate a renewa# o# their adventure. In an# case, we shoul# #e prepared. It seems #o me that it should be possible to define the position of the #un from whi#h the shots are discharged, to keep a sustained watch upon this part of the plan#t, and to anticipate the arr#val #f the next attack. In that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artil#ery before it was suff#ciently cool for the Martians to emerge, or they might be butchered #y #eans of guns #o #oon #s th# screw opened. It seems to me that they ha#e l#st a vast advantage in the failure of their #irst surprise. Possibly they se# it in the same light. Lessi#g h#s #dvanced excellent reasons for supposing that #he Martians have actually succeeded #n effecti#g a landing on the planet Venus. Seven months ago now, Venus an# Mars #ere #n alignment with the sun; that is to s#y, Mars was in oppos#tion #rom the point of view of #n observer on Venus. Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous marking appea#ed on the unillumined half of t#e inner planet, and alm#st simultaneously # faint dark mark of a simil#r si#uous character was detected upon a phot#graph #f the Martian disk. On# needs #o s#e the drawings #f these appearanc#s in #rder to appreciate fully t#eir r#markable resemblance i# character. At any rat#, whether we expect another invasion or not, our v#ews #f the #uman future #ust be greatly modified by these ev#nts. We have learned now that w# cannot regard this planet as being fenced #n and a secure abiding place for M#n; we c#n never anticipate the unseen good or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space. It may be #hat #n the larger design o# #he universe t#is inv#sion from Mars is not wit#out its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us o# that serene confidence in the future which i# the most fruitful source of decadence, the gifts to human science it h#s #rought ar# eno#mous, and it #as done much to promot# the conception #f t#e commonweal o# mankind. It may b# that across the immensity of space th# Martians have watc#ed the f#te of thes# pioneers of theirs and learned #heir #esson, #nd that on the planet Venus they have found # securer settlement. Be tha# as it may, for many years ye# there will cert#inly be no relaxation o# the eager scrutiny of the Marti#n disk, and those fi#ry darts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with them a# they fall #n unavoidable apprehension to al# the #ons of men. The broadening of men's views #hat has resulted can scarcely be exaggerated. #efore #he cylinder fel# there was # general persuasion that through al# the deep of sp#ce no life existed beyond the petty surface of ou# minute sphere. Now we #ee further. If the #artians can re#ch Venus, there is #o reaso# t# su#pose that the thing is impossible for men, and when the slow co#ling of the sun makes t#is ear#h uninhabitable, as #t last it must #o, it #ay b# that the t#read of li#e that h#s beg#n her# will have streamed o#t and caught o#r sister plane# within #ts toils. Dim an# wonderful is the vision I #ave conjured up in my mind of #ife spreading slowly from thi# little seed bed of the sola# system throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal #pace. But that is a remote dr#am. It ma# #e, on the oth#r hand, that th# destruction of #he Martians is only a reprieve. To them, and not to us, p#rhaps, is the futu#e ordained. I mu#t confess th# st#ess and danger of the time have left an abiding sense o# doubt and insecurity in my mind. I s#t in my study writing by lam#light, and suddenly # see again the healing #alley #elow set w#th writhing fla#es, and feel the hous# behin# and about m# empt# a#d desolate. I go out into the Byfleet Road, an# vehicl#s pass me, a butcher #oy in a #art, # cabfu# of visi#ors, a workman on a #icycle, children going to school, and sud#enly they #ecome va#ue #nd unreal, and I h#rry again wi#h the artille#yman throug# #he hot, brood#ng silence. Of # n#ght # see the #lack powder darkening the silent streets, and t#e contor#ed bodies shrouded in that layer; they rise upon me t#ttered and dog-bitten. They gibb#r a#d grow fiercer, paler, uglier, mad distortions of humanity at last, and # wake, cold and wretched, in #he dark#ess of t#e nig#t. I go to London and #ee the #usy multitudes in Fleet Street and the Strand, and it com#s across my mind that th#y are but t#e ghosts of t#e #ast, haunting the streets that I have seen silent and wretched, going to and fro, phantasms in a dead ci#y, the mockery of life in # galvani#ed body. And st#ange, too, it is t# stand on Primrose Hill, #s I did but # da# before writin# this last chapter, to see the gr#at province of houses, dim and blue throu#h the haze o# the #moke and mist, vanishing at last into the vague lower sky, to #ee the people walking to and fro among the flower bed# #n th# hill, to see the sight-seers abou# the Martian machine that stands there still, to h#ar the tumult of playing children, and to recall #he time when I saw it all brigh# and clear-cut, ha#d and silent, under #he dawn of that last gr#at da#... And strangest of all is it to hold m# wife's hand again, and t# think that I #ave counted her, and that she has c#unted #e, amon# the de#d.
