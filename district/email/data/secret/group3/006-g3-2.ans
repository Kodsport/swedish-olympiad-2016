Graded solutions to pset 4 now in DD2445 mailbox at CSC service center


Hi all,

This is just to tell you that graded solutions to pset 4 are now available for pick-up in the DD2445 mailbox at the CSC service center. We know that some exchange students have left KTH — all such students of whom we are aware of should already have received a scanned copy of their graded pset by e-mail. Let us know if we missed you.

Regarding bonus points, my travelling schedule is again complicating the matter of awarding them. I am writing this from New York, and by the time I have dealt with my jet lag here it will be time to leave for Singapore. I will go over all of our discussions again and add your points no later than the week starting February 8 (when I am back at KTH). I will try to get it done earlier if possible but cannot promise that this will happen.

Regarding the grading of pset 4, let me again stress that both Ilario and I are only human beings. Hence, even though we have discussed quite a number of proposed solutions in quite some detail it is very possible, or even likely, that there are cases where we didn't quite understand what you were saying or got things wrong. While it is primarily the responsibility of the students to write clear and correct solutions, we are more than willing to revise the grading when it turns out the mistake was on our side. Thus, if you think your problem set was not graded correctly, please do not hesitate to send a Piazza message to me.

Best regards,

Jakob
