<p>Hi all,</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is just to tell you that graded solutions to pset 4 are now availab=
le for pick-up in the DD2445 mailbox at the CSC service center. We know tha=

<p></p>

 matter of awarding them. I am writing this from New York, and by the time =
I have dealt with my jet lag here it will be time to leave for Singapore. I=
 will go over all of our discussions
 again and add your points no later than the week starting February 8 (when=
 I am back at KTH). I will try to get it done earlier if possible but canno=

<p></p>
<p>Regarding the grading of pset 4, let me again stress that both Ilario an=

 likely, that there are cases where
 we didn't quite understand what you were saying or got things wrong. While=
 it is primarily the responsibility of the students to write clear and corr=

 Thus, if you think your problem set was not graded correctly, please do <s=

Graded solutions to pset 4 now in DD2445 mailbox at CSC service center


Hi all,

This is just to tell you that graded solutions to pset 4 are now available =
for pick-up in the DD2445 mailbox at the CSC service center. We know that s=
ome exchange students have left KTH =97 all such students of whom we are aw=
are of should already have received a scanned copy of their graded pset by =
e-mail. Let us know if we missed you.

Regarding bonus points, my travelling schedule is again complicating the ma=
tter of awarding them. I am writing this from New York, and by the time I h=
ave dealt with my jet lag here it will be time to leave for Singapore. I wi=
ll go over all of our discussions again and add your points no later than t=
he week starting February 8 (when I am back at KTH). I will try to get it d=
one earlier if possible but cannot promise that this will happen.

Regarding the grading of pset 4, let me again stress that both Ilario and I=
 are only human beings. Hence, even though we have discussed quite a number=
 of proposed solutions in quite some detail it is very possible, or even li=
kely, that there are cases where we didn't quite understand what you were s=
aying or got things wrong. While it is primarily the responsibility of the =
students to write clear and correct solutions, we are more than willing to =
revise the grading when it turns out the mistake was on our side. Thus, if =
you think your problem set was not graded correctly, please do not hesitate=
 to send a Piazza message to me.

Best regards,

Jakob
